- Kids, breakfast!

- Kids? 

- Phil, would you get them?

- Yeah. Just a sec.

- Kids!

-  That is - Okay.

- Kids? Get down here!

- Why are you guys yelling at us when we're way upstairs?

-  Just text me. - All right. That's not gonna happen.

- And, wow! You're not wearing that outfit.

- What's wrong with it?

- Honey, do you have anything to say

-  to your daughter about her skirt? - Sorry.

-  Oh, yeah. That looks really cute, sweetheart. - Thanks.

- No. It's way too short.

- People know you're a girl.

- You don't need to prove it to them.

- Luke got his head stuck in the banister again.

- I got it. Where's the baby oil?

- It's on our bedside tab- I don't know. Find it.

- Come on!

- I was out of control growing up.

- There, you know? I said it.

- I-I just don't want my kids...

- to make the same bad mistakes I made.

- I-If Haley never wakes up on a beach in Florida, half-naked,

- I've done my job.

-  Our job. - Right.

- I've done our job.

- Vamos, Manny! Kick it! Kick it!

- Don't let him- Kick it!

- Manny, go! A la derecha! A la derecha!

- No! No, no.

- He tripped him, Jay. Where's the penalty?

- Gloria, they're 0 and 6.

- Let's take it down a notch.

- We're very different.

- Jay's from the city.

- He has a big business.

- I come from a small village.

- Very poor but very, very beautiful.

- It's the number one village in all Colombia for all the

- What's the word?

- Murders.

- Yes. The murders.

- Manny, stop him!

- Stop him! You can do it!

- Damn it, Manny!

- Come on, coach. You gotta take that kid out.

- You wanna take him out? How about I take you out?

-  Honey, honey. - Why don't you worry about your son?

- He spent the first half with his hand in his pants!

- I've wanted to tell her off for the last six weeks.

- I'm Josh. Ryan's dad.

- Hi, I'm Gloria Pritchett. Manny's mother.

-  Oh, and this must be your dad. - Her dad?

-  Yeah. - No, no. That's funny.

- Actually, no, I'm her husband.

- Don't be fooled by the, uh

- Give me a second here.

- Who is a good girl? Who's that?

- Who's that?

-  Oh, she's adorable. - Oh, thank you.

- Hi, precious. Hello.

- Uh, we just, uh- We just adopted her from Vietnam.

- And we're bringing her home for the first time, huh?

- She's an angel. You and your wife must be thrilled.

- Sorry, sorry, sorry. Daddy needed snacks.

- So, what are we talking about?

- Uh, we have been together for- guh, five- five years now?

- And, uh, we just- we decided we really wanted to have a baby.

- So, we had initially asked one of our

- lesbian friends to be a surrogate, but

- Then we figured, they're already mean enough.

- Can you imagine one of 'em pregnant? Pregnant, no.

- No, thank you. Ick.

- You saw that, right? Everybody fawning over Lily,

- and then you walk on and suddenly it's all,

- "Ooh, SkyMall.

- I gotta buy a motorized tie rack."

- All right, you know, I'm gonna give the speech.

- You are not giving the speech.

- You're gonna be stuck with these people for the next five hours.

- You're right, you're right. Okay. I'm sorry.

-  Look at that baby with those cream puffs. - Okay. Excuse me.

- Excuse me.

- This baby would have grown up in a crowded orphanage

- if it wasn't for us "Cream puffs."

-  And you know what? Note to all of you who judge- - Mitchell!

- Hear this. Love knows no race, creed

- Or gender.

-  And shame on you, - Mitchell.

-  you small-minded, ignorant few - Mitchell!

-  What? -She's got the cream puffs.

- We would like to pay for everyone's headsets.

- Buddy. Why do you keep getting stuck like this?

- I thought I could get out this time.

- I'm just gonna say it. He needs to be checked by a specialist.

- There. Be free.

- Excalibur.

-  I'm having a friend over today. - Who?

-  Uh, you don't know him. - Him? Him?

- Ooh, a boy. You gonna kiss him?

-  Shut up. - Easy. Easy.

-  Yeah, shut up! - No, you shut up!

- Luke, Alex, why don't you take it outside, okay?

- And do what?

-  Fight in the sun. It'll be a nice change. - Haley.

-  I'm kidding. - Who's the boy?

- His name is Dylan.

- I might as well tell him not to come...

- Because you guys are just going to embarrass me again.

- Sweetie, hang on a second.

- You're 15, and it's the first time you've had a boy over.

- I'm bound to be a little surprised,

- but I'm not gonna embarrass you.

- I better charge the camcorder.

- I'm kidding. Come on. Who are you talking to?

- I'm the cool dad. That's- That's my thing.

- I'm hip. I- I surf the Web.

- I text. "LOL"- Laugh out loud. 

- "OMG"- Oh, my God.

- "WTF"- Why the face?

- Um, you know, I know all the dances to High School Musical, so

- *We're all in this together *

- *Yes, we are*

- *We're all stars Something, something you know it*

-  Mom! Dad! - What happened?

-  Luke just shot me! - I didn't mean to.

-  Are you okay? - No.

- The little bitch shot me.

-  Language!  They're only plastic BBs. It was an accident.

- What did I tell you would happen if you got him a gun?

-  Deal with this. - Buddy, uncool.

- That's it? That's- No, no, no, no.

- The agreement was that if he shoots someone, you shoot him.

-  We were serious about that? - Yes, we were.

- And now you have to follow through.

-  I'm so sorry. - Liar.

-  Go. - He's got a birthday party.

- What's more important here, Dad?

- You can shoot him afterwards. He'll be home at 2:00.

- I can't shoot him at 2:00.

- I'm showing a house at 2:00.

-  What about 3:00? - No, he's got a soccer game at 3:00.

- And then- Oh, we gotta leave for that dinner thing at 5:00.

- 4:15. You could shoot him at 4:15.

- Yeah, I guess that works for me. Oh!

-  "Shoot Luke." - Sorry, dude. It's on the calendar.

- Oh, come on!

- I'm quitting soccer. It is a game for children.

- No, you're not quitting.

- You would have stopped that goal

- if you weren't staring at that little girl.

- She is not a girl. She's a woman.

- You know, Gloria, that little blowup with that other mom

- Why do you have to do things like that?

- If somebody says something about my family,

-  I'm going to - I'm just saying.

- You could take it down here a little bit. That's all.

- Oh, yeah. 'Cause that's where you live, down here.

-  But I live up here! - Yeah, but,

- you don't have to be so emotional all the time.That's all I'm saying.

- Manny, you're with me on this, right?

- I wanna tell Brenda Feldman I love her.

-  Oh, for God sakes. - Manny, she's 16.

- Oh. It's okay for you to take an older lover?

-  Hey, watch it. - I wanna go to the mall where she works.

- But first I need to get my white shirt, the silk one.

- Okay. If that's what you really want to do.

- Seriously. Not to be the evil stepdad,

- but if you put on a puffy white shirt...

- and declare your love for a 16-year-old,

- you're gonna be swinging from the flagpole

- in your puffy white underpants.

-  Stop the car. - Oh, where are you going?

- See? You hurt his feelings.

- Ah- Well, if it toughens him up a little bit then

- Oh, geez. He's picking flowers.

- Manny's very passionate, just like his father.

- My first husband- he's very handsome, but too crazy.

- It seemed like all we did was fight and make love,

- fight and make love, fight and make love.

- One time, I'm not kidding you, we fell out the window together.

- Which- Which one were you doing?

- I'm hearing this for the first time.

- This doesn't worry you?

- She barely slept on the plane and she's still wide awake.

-  Oh, stop worrying. - I can't.

- That- That orphanage was all women.

- Maybe she just- she can't fall asleep unless she feels a woman's shape.

-  I guess that's possible. - So here.

- What the hell is that supposed to mean?

- Yes,

- I've gained a few extra pounds while we were expecting the baby,

- which has been very difficult.

- But apparently your body

- does a nesting, very maternal, primal thing...

- where it retains nutrients

- some sort of molecular physiology thing.

- But that's science.

- You can't- You can't fight it, so

-  I'm not saying anything. - You're saying everything.

-  Count to three. - One, two

-  Three. - Okay.

-  Oh, Cam. This is beautiful. - Oh, my God. Do you love it?

- Yes, I

- What the hell is that?

- I had Andre do it while we were gone.

- Is that us, with wings?

- We're floating above her, always there to protect her.

- Okay. Well, that's reassuring, right, Lily?

- Yes, we tore you away from everything you know,

- but don't worry, things are normal here.

- Your fathers are floating fairies.

- No, can you call Andre,

- have him paint something a little less gay?

- By the way, we need to stop having friends

- with names like Andre.

-  Redheaded dad is angry daddy. - No, I'm not.

- Yes, you are.

- Even Pepper pointed it out on the way home from the airport.

- Okay, that's another one- Pepper.

- Okay, what's up?

- All right, look. I

- I- I never told my family we were adopting a baby.

-  And... - I know.

-  You do? - Yeah, and I don't blame you. I know your family.

- You'd tell 'em. They'd say something judgmental.

-  Exactly. - You'd get mad.

- I know. And then something that's supposed to be nothing but joyful

- suddenly turns into this huge fight.

- And who wants a big, emotional scene like that?

- Thank you. Thank you.

- I'm so- I'm so relieved you understand.

- I invited them over for dinner tonight.

-  What? - I had to.

- This would have gone on forever. You're an avoider.

- No. No. No. Cam, I'm calling them right now and canceling.

- No, you're not.

- You're telling your family you adopted a baby, tonight.

- And you do have avoidance issues. Even Longinus said so.

- Are- Are you really not hearing these names?

- Don't answer it! I'll get it!

- Hi. Hey, you must be Dylan.

-  Hey. Dylan. Yeah. - I'm Haley's mother.

-  Come on. Let's go. - Okay. Um

- Hang on one second.

- Dylan, you're still in high school?

-  Yeah, I'm a senior. -A senior. Okay. Cool.

- Hey, Phil. Sweetie. Honey. He is Dylan, and he is a senior.

- You have to scare him.

- Let me meet this "Playa."

- Phil Dunphy, yo.

- It's like that. You just- You just stare down at 'em,

- let the eyes do the work.

- Your mouth might be saying, "Hey, we cool,"

- but your eyes are like, "No, we not."

- "Nice to meet you." "No, it's not."

- "It's all good."

- "No, it's not."

-  Okay, I see you two guys- - Wait, wait, wait.

- You two

- You two keep it real, know what I mean, son?

- Not really.

-  Please, stop. - That's cool.

-  Ow. Oh, God! That's my back. - Oh, honey. Sweetheart.

- Ow! Oh! I slipped in the baby oil.

- "Oh, where you from originally?"

- "I could defeat you if it came to a physical confrontation."

- I don't know about this. Should I call a doctor?

- No, no, no, no, no. Okay.

-  You're very strong, homes. - Thanks.

-  Okay. Nice- Nice soft landing. - There you go.

-  Okay, let's go. Come on. - I am on my side though.

- So just flip me right back, and we're good.

- We'll be good.

- I just need to get flipped right on my back,

- and we should be fine. So

- Brenda Feldman.

-  What is that? - A poem I have written for Brenda Feldman.

- Of course it is.

- I put my thoughts into words and now my words into action.

- Hey, I'll give you 50 bucks not to do this.

- I'm 11 years old. What am I gonna do with money?

- What are you gonna do with a 16-year-old?

-  He's like a bullfighter. - Mmm. You ever see a bullfight?

- I can't watch this. - You're in such a bad mood.

- And I know why. It's because that man thought you were my father.

-  No. - Yes.

-  No. - When you say "No" like that, it's always "Yes."

- Come on. We're in the mall.

- Let's get you, like, some younger clothes.

-  There's a store there. - I don't need any younger clothes.

- And I don't care what some jackass

- in a pair of ripped jeans thinks about me.

- Good. You shouldn't.

- You should only care what I think.

- I love you, and I don't care how old you are.

- So stop being a gloomy goose and stop being so hard on Manny.

- The only reason I'm hard on Manny...

- Is just because I don't wanna see him make a fool of himself.

- And I can smell that hair goo of his from here.

- Look, I don't know what's gonna happen to him over there.

- But you're his family now, and that means only one thing

- You be the wind in his back, not the spit in his face.

-  What? -It's something my mom always says.

- It's gorgeous in Spanish.

- Look, he's there.

-  She has a boyfriend. - Oh, I'm sorry, mi nino.

- I gave her my heart,

- she gave me a picture of me as an old-time sheriff.

-  That was pretty stupid of me, wasn't it? - No, mi amor.

- It was brave. Right, Jay? Brave.

- W-Well, you'll know better next time.

- Come on. Let's get a pretzel.

- Mentira. A me se me gusta.

- Uh, excuse me, sir.

- We ask that all mall-walkers stay to the right.

- Alex, get out! Mom!

- Alex, leave your sister alone.

- I was just getting my book. Gosh.

- I know, sweetie. But you need to respect their privacy.

-  What are they doing up there? - Nothing.

- Lying on her bed, watching a movie.

- Okay. Okay.

- Um, I'm making a cake for tonight.

- You wanna help me with the frosting?

- Sure.

- So, you know, if Haley got pregnant,

- would you ever pretend she has mono for a few months,

- and then, like, tell everyone the baby's yours?

-  What? - This senior at school was "Out sick" for four months,

- but Jenna Resnick swears she saw her breast-feeding

- at a coin-op car wash.

- Buddy, what are you wearing?

-  Nothing. - Uh-uh. No jacket.

- One hat.

- How many pairs of underwear do you have on?

- One.

- Six.

- First of all, it would be really cool to see Haley that fat.

- And how awesome would it be

- to have a fake little brother who's really my nephew.

- Haley is not getting pregnant.

-  Just saying "If." - I know.

- And I know you like to make trouble for your sister,

- but it's not gonna work this time.

- You know why? 'Cause your sister's a good girl.

- I know. I was just like her when I was

- I want you to know, I'm not enjoying this.

- But this is an important lesson that you're learning.

- So, soak it. Keep it.

- You're too close. It's gonna hurt.

- It's supposed to hurt.

-  And why are you smiling? - I'm- What?

- Oh, forget it. I can't do this.

- The point is you're scared. I think you've learned your lesson.

- Mom! What are you doing?

- Oh, hey! I was just, um, dropping off some laundry.

-  Is this a bad time? - Yeah.

- Oh. Okay.

- Uh, can you shut the door, please?

- Actually, we're just gonna go ahead and leave that open.

- Why?

- Because I have, uh, seen this little show before

- Lying on the bed with a tall senior.

- One minute you're just friends, watching Falcon Crest,

- and the next you're lying underneath the air hockey table

- with your bra in your pocket.

- Mom!

-  You hit my bone! - It was an accident!

-  I thought you were my friend! - I am your friend.

- Dad! Dad, Dad. You have got to talk to Mom.

- She is, like, completely freaking out and embarrassing me!

- Honey, your mom isn't always as cool about things as

- What is with this thing?

- My dad.

- Uh, my dad still isn't completely comfortable with this.

- Um- He-He still does this thing. It's been five years now.

- And he still does this thing where he announces himself...

- before walking into any room we're in...

- just to make sure he doesn't have to ever see us kiss.

- Wish my mother had that system.

-  Remember? - Not now.

- I still can't believe you did this to me.

- Would you get in the spirit of things? It's a celebration.

- Oh, God.

-  Okay, I'm gonna go get Lily ready. - Okay.

-  And I want you to just come straight out with it. - All right.

- Okay. You can do this.

- Yeah. Sports guy chest bump.

-  No. - Sports guy chest bump.

-  Cam. Oh! All right. Go - Do it.

- Sorry.

-  How are you? - Hi, guys. Hey.

- That looks good. Oh, thank you. Thanks.

- Don't thank us. Open it. Dad is coming right behind.

- Knock, knock! We're here. Coming in!

- Don't worry, Dad. Nothing gay going on here.

- May I take your multicolored coat and bejeweled cap?

-  Yeah. Yeah. - Hey, Jay.

-  Gloria, hi. - Hi.

-  How are you? Hi, Dad. - Hi, Gloria. How are you?

-  Oh, what a beautiful dress. - Ay, thank you, Phil.

- Okay. 

- Oh, hey, Phil.

- That's how she says "Phil." Not "Feel." Phil.

-  So how was your trip? - It was good. It was good actually.

- But, um, about that, I- I

- have something that I need to tell you guys.

- Um- Uh, we didn't just go to Vietnam for pleasure.

- We, uh, kind of have some big news.

- Oh, God. If Cam comes out here with boobs, I'm leaving.

-  Dad. - I hope he didn't embarrass you, Mom.

- Oh, don't mind her. Haley had her first boy over today...

- And Phil shot him.

- Anyway, um, so, about- about a year ago,

- Cam and I started feeling this longing, you know,

- for something more, like, uh, maybe a baby?

-  Ooh, that's a bad idea. - What do you mean, "Bad idea"?

- Well, kids need a mother.

- I mean if you two guys are bored, get a dog.

- Okay, we're not bored, Dad.

- I support you, Mitchell, even though you're not my son.

- I-I-I-I think what Dad is trying to say...

- is that, Mitchell, you're a little uptight.

- Kids bring chaos, and- and you don't handle it well.

- That's not what Dad's saying.

- That's what you're saying.

- And it's insulting in a whole different way.

- Okay, people. Let's all "Chillax."

-  Hey, where's Uncle Cameron? - Thank you. Thank you.

- Someone who's not insulting me notices he's not here.

- Oh, so that's the big announcement, huh?

- You two broke up.

- Well- Well, a baby wasn't gonna help that anyway.

- And let me tell you. You're better off,

- because he was a bit of a drama queen.

- No, no, no. Stop. Stop. No.

- You come into my house and you insult me and my boyfriend,

- who, by the way, is not that dramatic

- We adopted a baby.

- Her name is Lily.

-  Exciting! - Just turn it off.

- I can't turn it off. It's who I am.

-  The music. - Oh, yes, the music.

- Come say hi to Lily.

- Ay, miren a la princesita.

- The little princess.

-  She's so cute! - Thank you.

- Let me see her. Let me see her.

- Hi there, Lily.

- "Lily." Isn't that gonna be hard for her to say?

-  Phil. - Excuse me.

- Okay, I-I-I know that I said I thought this was a bad idea.

- But, uh, what do I know?

- I mean, it's not like I wrote the book on fatherhood.

- Been trying all my life to get it right. I'm still screwing up.

-  Right, Manny? - I wrote a song about it in the car.

- Of course you did.

- Anyway, I'm happy for you.

- And, uh, you should know that, uh,

- I'm not here to spit in your face,

- I'm here to... blow at your back.

-  I don't understand what that means. - I don't

- Well, it's- it's supposed to sound better in Spanish.

- Oh, that's beautiful. That's really nice.

- And thank you too.

- Anyhow, Mitch, uh

- No, Dad, it's- it's- 

-  I got her. I got her. - Oh, she's crying.

- She wants her grandpa! She wants her daddy!

-  Do you wanna meet Grandpa? - What? Are you kidding?

- She's one of us now. Let me see the little pot sticker.

- Hey, you're a cutie, aren't you?

- Ah. Look at this.

- We're from different worlds, yet we somehow fit together.

- Love is what binds us, through fair or stormy weather.

- I stand before you now with only one agenda

- "To let you know my heart is yours,

- Feldman comma Brenda."

- I mean, seriously.

- Luke, so far, hasn't beaten me in basketball.

- It's 2-0. 2-0. Okay. Okay.

-  Get that weak stuff out of my kitchen! - Dad, stop it!

- Can you do me a favor? Just grab

- How's the weather down there?

- But when the day comes that he does win

- if- you know- if/when

- he beats me, I'm just gonna be like,

- "Well done. Well done."

- Just, like, let him- Just support him...

- in- in- in that kind of stuff.

- I mean, I'd probably want to go, like,

- two out of three and just see what happens there, but

S01E02 
----------------------
- What's the key to being a great dad?

- Ah, that's a tough one.

- Giving them the freedom to be whatever they want to be.

-  Right. Exactly. - Whether that's a painter,

- a poet, a pilot, a president

- And for us, we're gonna 

- of a company or of a country.

- Patience.

- Well, be their buddy.

-  That's your answer? - And stay in school.

-  No. - And don't do drugs.

- No!

-  Just give me the answer. - 0h, God.

- Still thinking.

-  Hi, Claire. - Hey.

-  Hey. - Oh, okay.

- Hi. Um, this is my husband, Phil.

-  Hi. - And, uh, that's my son, Luke, right there.

-  This is - Desiree.

-  Desiree, right. Sorry. - Oh, hi.

-  Desiree just moved in down the block. - Fun. Where?

-  314. - Oh!

- The two-bedroom cottage with the indoor-outdoor family room.

- Very good. How did you

- Bet you're lovin' that steam shower. 

- Phil, that's creepy.

- 0h, sorry. I'm a- I'm a real estate mogul.

- "What?" No, I'm a- I am a real estate agent.

- We caravanned that house. Great, uh, deck.

- Thanks. I'm just there till my divorce is final.

- No, who is coconuts enough to divorce you?

- We gotta go, but we'll see you around.

- We'll have to have you over sometime.

-  I'd love it. - All right.

-  Bye. - Bye.

-  She's awesome. - No, we are never having her over.

- Heard she already slept with two dads from the school.

-  What? - Mm-hmm.

- That's horrible.

-  Dad, watch out! - Whoa! Watch it, buddy!

-  Grandma. - I'm sorry.

- That still looks like a girl's bike.

- We'll add more black tape.

- My son has been riding his sister's old bike.

- Until he's responsible enough to take care of his own bike.

- Look, he spilled a soda on my computer,

- he ruined our digital camera

- taking pictures of himself underwater.

- It's a girl's bike. I'm all for teaching him a lesson.

- But I worry about the ridicule he might get from some loudmouth bully.

- Hey, hey, hey. Nice bike, Sally.

- Dad! 

- Come on. He looks like Little Bo Peep on that thing.

- Actually, not for long. He's getting a new bike this afternoon.

-  I am? - Mm-hmm.

- He is?

- Sometimes a man's gotta put his foot down

- and do what a man's gotta do.

- And if the old lady don't like it

- Honey?

- That's too damn bad.

- Yes. Who's excited, huh?

- Cam, come on. Hurry up. We're gonna be late.

- It's a toddler play class, not a flight to Cabo.

- We're gonna be judged enough as the only gay parents there.

- I don't wanna be the late ones too.

- Wow! Paisley and pink.

- Was there something wrong with the fishnet tank top?

- Obviously not. I'm wearing it underneath.

- Kidding. Just chill, please. Here.

- I'm sorry. I just wanna make a good first impression.

- You wanna fit in and not terrify the villagers? 

- Hey, come on.

- Today is about Lily, all right?

- Her future best friend might be in that class,

- and I don't wanna rub anyone the wrong way.

- Can you please just change your shirt?

- Fine. You know what?

- I'll just go put on a pair of khakis,

- maybe a polo shirt, and everybody will think

- we're a couple straight golfin' buddies...

- who just decided to have a kid together.

- Hey, I called that place in Napa and

- got us upgraded to a villa with a hot tub.

- So pack whatever you wear in a hot tub.

- I usually wear nothing when I'm in a hot tub.

- And my college roommate's wife just had to get a new hip.

- Sucker.

- Manny's father is taking him for a couple of days to Disneyland,

- so we're gonna go to the wine country.

- We're gonna drink some wine, eat some good food.

- You know, we would do something like this

- a lot more often if it wasn't for, you know, Manny.

-  He's good. He keep us grounded. - Yeah.

- Like fog at an airport.

- Limo gets here at 4:00.

- This morning, I thought I'd go to the club, hit a few balls.

- No! What about the fan in Manny's room?

- 0h, yeah. Call a guy.

- No! You're supposed to do it with him.

- It's important that we teach him how to do things for himself.

- In my culture, men take great pride in doing physical labor.

- I know. That's why I hire people from your culture.

- You're too funny.

- I'm gonna share that one with my next husband

- when we're spending all your money.

-  Dad, this is the coolest bike ever. - Awesome.

- So, listen, buddy.

- Certain members of this family

- don't think you can take care of this bad boy.

-  You mean Mom? - Your words, not mine.

- Look, uh, your mom and I are a team,

- and she- we feel like this is a chance

- for you to show some responsibility.

- Don't make us look like jerks here.

-  I won't. - Okay.

-  One more rule. - What?

- Have, like, three butt-loads of fun.

- Thanks, Dad.

-  So let's do this. - 0kay, but I need to be done by 3:00.

- That's when my dad's picking me up.

- Hey, if we're not done by 3:00,

- I'm gonna tie a noose on this thing.

- In Colombia there's a saying:

- "If you have two stubborn burros that don't like each other,

- you tie them to the same cart."

- The ceiling fan is the cart.

- My dad's taking me on Space Mountain.

- It's supposed to be really fast, but he's not scared of anything.

- He doesn't even wear a seat belt when he drives.

- Wow. How 'bout that?

-  Killed a bear once. - Really?

- Was the bear sittin' in the passenger seat?

- Read me the instructions.

- "Safety tips. Warning: To reduce the risk of electrical shock"

- We can skip that.

- Uh, "Failure to heed these warnings

- can lead to serious injury or death."

- You know, you worry too much. You know that.

- Nobody's gonna get shocked.

- One time my dad was struck by lightning.

- That's why he can drink as much as he wants.

- Manny thinks his dad is like Superman.

- The truth? He's a total flake.

- In fact, the only way he's like Superman...

- is that they both landed in this country illegally.

- I can't believe I'm so nervous.

- They're gonna love us. Let's just be ourselves.

- 0r a slightly toned-down version of ourselves.

- I just don't want this to become an episode of "The Cam Show."

-  0h, my gosh. People love "The Cam Show." - Yes, I know.

-  You watch "The Cam Show." - I do watch it.

-  It's appointment viewing. - Okay.

-  Hi! - Hi! Are you here for Toddler Time?

- Yes. I-I'm Mitchell. This is Cameron.

-  And this here is Lily. - Hello.

- 0h, well! Welcome.

- We're all over here taking turns blowing bubbles.

- Well, how nice for... the babies.

- Mm-hmm.

- This is gonna be really difficult.

- Ten minutes after making a promise to me,

- he leaves his bike unlocked.

- All I can hear is Claire's voice in my head

- "He's not responsible.

- You never should have given him a bike."

- I know. I do a pretty good Claire.

- So I decided to teach him a lesson...

- and let him think his bike was stolen.

- And I know that sounds kind of rough,

- but sometimes it's a dad's job to be the tough guy.

- Excuse me! Thank you.

- On your left! My left. Your right!

- Everyone, we have a new family joining us today.

- Hi. I'm, uh, Mitchell, and I am a lawyer.

- I- I'm Cameron, and I'm currently not working,

- which gives me more time to grill and shoot baskets and

- And this is Lily.

- Okay, we're gonna start with the Hello Dance,

- and then we're gonna move on to blocks, then finger painting,

- and then we're gonna do our Family Dance.

- All right. Who wants to start us off?

- Dance us in, P. J.!

-  She's adorable. - Oh, thank you.

-  Seven months? - Uh, eight.

- 0h! Is she grabbing or scooting yet?

- Yes. Absolutely.

- I mean, when she's not grabbin', she is- she is scootin'.

- Dance us in, Tyler!

- Are you ready? Okay. Here we go.

- Cam, Lily is not grabbing or scooting yet.

- Well, she's not doing it yet, but she will eventually.

- No, but, see, a lot of these other kids,

- they're- they're grabbing.

- I-I just- Here. Come

- Lily. Look at the block, huh?

- Grab the block, Lily.

-  Grab the "H." - Dance us in, Lily!

-  Okay. I got this. - Cam, just

- Yes, I know. Tamp down my natural gifts

- and dance like a straight guy.

- No slapping your own butt.

- But that's how I make my horsey go.

- Thank you.

- That was very good.

- I feel dirty.

-  0h, hey. - Hey! Hi.

-  Hi. - Hi.

- Uh, this is really embarrassing,

- but I locked myself out of my house.

- 0h! Pssh! I do that all the time. Don't be embarrassed.

- I was- I was hoping you could help me.

- There's a window open, but I can't reach it.

- Would you mind?

-  Yeah. Yeah. Sure. - Great.

- 0f course. You know what they say

- "Every time God closes a door, he opens a window."

- 0r I guess in this case, every time he locks you out.

- Okay, what do we got here?

- I mean, am I attracted to her? Yes.

- Would I ever act on it? No. No way.

- Not while my wife is still alive.

- Are you sure I can't get you something to drink?

- Yeah. No, I'm- I'm fine. Really.

- If I knew a man was gonna climb into my bedroom window,

- I would have cleaned up a bit.

- Are you kidding me? It smelled great in there.

- Like lotions and oils...

- for... dry skin and, you know, calloused hands.

- Yeah, it's a candle.

-  Uh-oh. - What's wrong?

-  The bike's gone. - Oh, no.

-  Can I help you find it? - That's all right. Thank you.

- 0kay. Thank you!

- So, to teach him a lesson, I took his bike,

- and then- crazy thing

- I put it down for one minute, and someone swiped it from me.

- Maybe that was your dad teaching you a lesson.

- Zinger.

- So, any chance I could, uh, get a break on this one?

-  I can throw in a bell. - Deal.

-  For five dollars. - No, sir.

- So, you wanna go for the insurance this time,

- or is it still for suckers?

- Got me again.

- Well played, milord.

- I will take some insurance. Thank you.

- What's going on in there?

-  That's not step four. - Don't worry about it.

-  It says right here that you should- - That's worrying about it.

- I thought you guys might need a drink.

- 0h, you have no idea.

- Manny, miamor, I have to go get some stuff for our trip.

- Ay! But have some fun with your father, okay?

- And I'll see you Monday. Mwah!

- It makes me so happy to see my two boys working together.

-  Jay shocked himself twice. - 0kay, Manny.

-  Well, I warned him. - Yep, he's been a big help.

- Look at you two with your private jokes already.

- You're a regular Salazar and El Oso.

- It's a very big comedy team in Colombia.

- El Oso is always hitting Salazar in the head

- with the ladder and things.

- And sometimes they wear dresses. Hmm.

- They make you laugh, but they also make you think.

- You blew it. You made me look bad.

- No, you made your mother and I look bad. We are a team.

-  Luke, you in there? - Hey, Dad.

- Hey. Hey, buddy.

- That was, uh- That was pretty fun today, huh? Getting a new bike.

-  Yeah, it was awesome. - So, uh, what happened after I took off?

-  Anything you want to share with me? - Not really.

- So, if I, uh, went out to the garage,

- took a picture for a scrapbook, there'd be no surprises?

- I'm so sorry! I didn't mean it. I just made a mistake.

- Yeah, a big mistake!

- You're making me look really bad here.

- I told Mom you were ready for this.

- It's just a scratch, Dad. 

- That's not the point, Luke! What?

- I scratched it on my way into the driveway. I'm sorry.

- So, it's not stolen?

- No. Why?

- That's good,

- 'cause... there are bad people out there who would steal a bike.

- Those are thieves.

- You sit there and think about the scratch part.

- That's not good either.

- I gotta fix that step.

- So don't scratch anything while I'm gone,

- unless it itches. That's different.

- The good news is, Luke has his bike.

- More good news

- I taught some random kid a valuable lesson by stealing his bike.

- Best news- Claire knows nothing.

- So, I figure I'll just dump the new bike

- where I stole the first bike.

- That way, random kid gets his back,

- and this new bike doesn't raise a lot of embarrassing questions...

- like why I had it

- or who boosted who through a bedroom window.

- So, everybody's happy.

- Ah, son of a- You gave me the wrong screwdriver.

- Maybe you're just using it wrong.

- My dad's great with tools.

- He can get the wheels off a car in less than a minute.

- Just get me to wine country. Just get me to wine country.

- Sorry!

-  I think my arm is broken. - Relax. It's not broken.

- How do you know? You don't know anything.

- You have no concern for safety.

-  Because it didn't hit you that hard. - Why don't you just say it?

-  You don't want me around. - You know what? Right now, I don't!

- I don't wanna be with you either. I'm gonna go wait for my dad.

- 0h, but- but if you leave, how will I ever finish?

- You know what? I wish you never married my mom.

-  I hate living here. - You think I like this arrangement?

- I got a two-seater parked in the driveway!

- I mean, I don't understand.

- Why are you trying to sneak around and hide things from me?

-  I actually think it's pretty funny. - You do?

- I do. Yes.

- I mean, you steal a bike from some poor kid,

- and then the bike gets stolen from you.

- It's hilarious.

-  Classic me, right? - Yeah!

- So, where were you when it got stolen?

- Oh, I was getting some gas.

- Uh-huh. You don't stand near the car when you get gas?

- Yep, but, uh, I went inside to get a soda 

- because I was thirsty,

- and if I had a soda, I wouldn't be thirsty anymore.

- So I bought one, then I drank it all right there,

- which is why I don't have the can.

- Well, honey, please, let's try to remember

- that I'm your wife, not your mom.

- So in the future, you don't need to hide things from me. Okay?

-  0kay. - Okay.

-  0kay. - Oh! Oh, yeah.

-  You get back here, you! - What are you doing, Phil?

- I just love ya so darn much!

-  I know. I love you too, but that hurts. - Let's get you inside.

-  Hi. - I know. That's hurting a lot.

-  This is a hot one. - Hello! Hi there!

-  Hi again. - Oh, hi.

- I, uh, found your bike.

- Oh, good! You

-  At the gas station? - No, at my house.

- One of my neighbors saw it and put it in my garage

- when you were in my bedroom, so

- Classic me?

- Come on, honey. Grab the block.

- See, like he did. You gotta do that.

-  You gotta grab it like him. - So, seen any movies lately?

- Uh, yeah.

- You know, my husband and I just rented,

- uh, Mamma Mia! Which I liked,

- but I don't know that Meryl Streep was the right choice.

- What did you think?

- Excuse me.

- Meryl Streep could play Batman and be the right choice.

- She's perfection...

- whether she's divorcing Kramer, whether she's wearing Prada.

- Don't even get me started on Sophie's Choice.

- I get emotional thinking about it.

- She couldn't forgive herself.

- I guess she was okay.

- Really? Ooh.

- Grab the blocks, sweetheart.

-  You're not even interested in it. - Is Henry stacking?

- Good job, Henry!

- Good job!

- Q-R-S T-U-V
 Q  R  S  T  U  V 

- W-X-Y and Z

- Now I know my

- Whoa, Lily! Oh!

- Not so high. Wow!

-  That is a big moment for her. - Yeah.

- Would you like a videotape?

- Uh, you know, I don't

- I don't know if I can actually get her to do it again, so

- Well, we tape all of our classes.

- We don't like parents bringing cameras in.

- It keeps them out of the moment.

- I'll get you a copy after class.

- That's super. Yeah. Great. Thank you.

- Cam. Cam, let's go.

- I don't know what's happened to me,

- but I just stole a baby's intellectual property.

-  What? - You'll see it tonight on the news.

-  Come on. Let's just go. - Oh, look who's here!

-  Anton and Scott! - Sorry we're late!

- Don't look at me. The eye candy here can't leave the house...

- without spending 20 minutes in front of the mirror.

- Are you kidding me?

- I am so sorry.

- Look at those queens. I would have killed with this crowd.

- But you had to clip my wings

- which you used to be the wind beneath.

- I know. I'm sor

- This class has turned me into a complete monster.

- I'm- I'm just- I'll make it up to you. Let's just go.

- Okay, it's time for Parents Dance.

- Everybody dance for your baby!

- You wanna do it, don't you?

- I do.

- I wanna dance for my baby.

-  All right. Go on. Get in there. - You sure?

- Make that horsey move. Go ahead.

- Go, go!

- 0h, I think I hurt myself.

- Hello. Hey, Javier.

- Manny's waiting for you outside.

- What? Why not?

- Hold that thought.

- His son's sitting on a curb, waiting to go to Disneyland,

- and Superman can't drag himself away from a craps table,

- and I'm the jerk.

- Say, listen.

- I, uh

-  Sorry, but I got some bad news. - What?

- Your dad couldn't make it.

- Why not?

- The plane was full,

- and this old lady needed to get home, so he gave up his seat.

-  You're making that up, aren't you? - No.

- He just didn't want to come.

- Are you kidding me? He was very upset. He was dying to see you.

- In fact, look what he sent.

-  A limo? - Yeah.

- He wanted me and your mom to take you to Disneyland.

-  I told you he was an awesome dad. - Yeah, he's a prince.

- Okay. The key to being a good dad?

- Sometimes things work out just the way you want.

- Race you to the end. 

- That is not a good idea... for you.

- Sometimes they don't.

- You gotta hang in there.

- Because when all is said and done,

- 90% of being a dad...

- is just showin' up.

- Hey! That's my bike!

- Oh, I don't, uh

- Well

-  You- - I was giving it back!

- She couldn't forgive herself.

- And...

- she had to choose.

- I think because now I have

- we have- we have

- we have Lily,

- it's so hard to imagine being put in that position.

- If I had to choose Lily or Mitchell,

- I mean, I would choose

- I don't know! I don't know!

- I don't know!

- I don't know!

S01E03 
----------------------
- Riley Morton coming up now.

- Kelly at second. Started the inning with a double.

- That seems like an hour ago.

-  Honey, I thought you were gonna take out the garbage. - I am.

- High fly to right. Hooking, hooking- Foul.

-  Phil. - Yes. Getting it.

- I was- I was gonna get it.

-  Dylan. - Hey, Mrs. Dunphy.

- Um, I'm just waiting for Haley.

-  Did you ring the bell? - I texted.

- She said she'd be down in just a minute.

-  Oh, great. Tell her I said "Hi." - I will.

- Dylan! D-Money!

- Chillin' with Dylan the villain!

-  "D" To the "Y" To the- - Hey, Mr. Dunphy.

- Hey! Come on in.

- You're just in time to catch the end of the game.

- Oh, I'm not really a baseball guy.

- Haley says "Hi."

- I was just being facetious. 

- Come on. I'll catch you up.

- Sit it. Park it.

- Come on. I don't bite.

- Kidding.

- I'm kidding.

- Okay. See that guy? He's the tying run.

- Interesting story about him.

- He's been stuck on second base forever,

- and I'm pretty sure he's gonna try and steal third,

- which is just a terrible, terrible idea.

- How are you and Haley doing?

- I wish I could stay home with you and fly toy airplanes.

- These aren't toy airplanes, Manny.

- These are models, and they're very complicated.

- You wanna fly one of these, you gotta be familiar with airfoil,

- drag, lift and thrust

- and these are all principles of aerodynamics.

- The box says "12 and up."

- What?

- You can fly toy planes with Jay next time.

-  Today you have to spend time with Luke. - Why?

- Because his mother invited you, so you go.

- Family needs to be close. Right, Jay?

- I'm pretty sure this is a typo.

- Men need their hobbies. Manny's father had many hobbies.

- Like hiking in the desert,

- that kind of skiing that they drop you from the

- How do you say in English?

-  Helicopter. - Yes.

- Once, on a dare, he even boxed with an alligator.

- "Wrestle." You wrestle

- You can't box with alligators.

- Are you sure?

- How would they get the gloves on those little claws?

-  Aren't they like tiny little hands? - No!

- Okay, now I forgot what we're talking about.

- Anyways, hobbies are important for the men,

- whether you're risking your life...

- or flying little planes from a safe distance.

- Wait, wait, wait. What are you doing?

- Uh, we're just gonna buy some diapers. It'll just take a second.

-  This is Costco. - Yeah, which is where we buy diapers.

- Since when?

- Do you remember when we adopted that baby a few months back?

- Since then.

- Mitchell is a snob.

- No. N-No, I-I'm discerning.

- Official slogan for snobs.

- When we first met, he wouldn't even look at me...

- because I was a hick from the farm in Missouri,

- and he's a big city mouse.

- Who says "City mouse"?

- Country mice.

-  I think I'm gonna go wait in the car. - Okay.

- Hey, if you're on your way out, can you grab the garbage?

-  I got it. - Okay. We got it.

-  He's a little jumpy. - Oh, go figure

- a teenage boy doesn't want to hang out with his girlfriend's dad.

- Thought we were past all that.

- I'm all about

-  I'm all about taking it to the next level. - Really?

-  Thought you were all about keeping it real. - Yes.

- But the whole point of keeping it real is

- so you can take it to the next level.

- Did you really not know that?

- You haven't exactly taken it to the next level with my dad.

- What are you talking about?

- We've been married for 16 years,

- and you still walk on eggshells around him.

- What? Are you kidding?

- Jay and I are total buds.

- You-You want to just hang out?

- Brought six friends, so that just

- That's

- Manny brought his favorite game to play with Luke.

- It's called Empire.

- You use strategy to expand territories and take over the world.

- Luke is gonna love that. He's out back playing.

- Do you need me to get you something while I'm out shopping?

- That's such a nice offer, but I think we're good. Thanks.

- Okay. What about this?

- You don't even say "Hello" To Gloria and Manny?

- Hi, Gloria and Manny. Okay, Mom, what about this?

-  No. You're wearing a dress. - Mom, come on.

- What? It's gonna kill you to look like a girl for one afternoon?

- But it's a wedding for some friend of yours I never even heard of.

- It's non-negotiable. You can borrow a dress of Haley's again.

- No. 

- That sends an ugly message- that I'm Haley.

- You know, instead of trying to force me to wear a dress,

- why don't you worry about getting Luke to wear some pants?

- What? Why does he do this?

- Luke!

- Pants! Come on!

- Jay and I are buds, for sure

- but with kind of, um, an invisible asterisk.

- Um, he's not, uh- He's not a talker.

- Or-Or a hugger.

- Once he ran over my foot with his car.

- To-To be fair, he had just given up smoking,

- but basically we're-we're buds.

- Do you have to just stand there?

- You're making me feel uneasy.

- Oh, for God's sake. Sit here. Here.

- Hold this wing like this while I adjust this.

- Okay.

- Come on. Here.

- Not too hard.

- Alex, why don't you come shopping with me?

- Maybe I can help you find something that you like.

- That's a really nice offer, but it's not really her thing.

- Actually, I'd love to go.

- See, you don't know what my thing is.

- You have no idea what my thing is.

- I know what your thing is.

- Your thing is to provoke, just like your sister's thing...

- is to never come out of her room, 

- and your brother's thing

- Well, there's your brother's thing.

- Luke! Put 'em on! Mm-hmm.

- The thing about me and Jay is our relationship's...

- always been stuck in that,

- that primal place where it started.

- You know, he's the old silverback protecting his females,

- then along comes this younger, stronger gorilla swinging in, 

- beating his chest.

- You know, naturally, the ape ladies come running,

- presenting their nice scarlet behinds.

- Papa ape wants to stop all that, but he can't.

- You know? That's-That's life. I'm not the enemy.

- The enemy is poachers.

- That'll do it. Don't touch it.

- All right.

-  You wanna go fly it? - Sure.

- Oh. Hey, I got the toothpaste and the soap.

- Good. Now we can open that general store.

- I thought we were just here to get diapers.

- We had a saying on the farm:

- as long as you're bringing the mule to the market, you

- I feel you rolling your eyes at me.

- We met at one of Pepper's legendary game nights.

- I remember Mitchell because 

- he kept rolling his eyes every time I would get a little boisterous.

- I did not.

- A little bit.

- Yeah, maybe a little bit.

- Anyway, we were- we were playing charades,

- and I had no idea how to act out my clue.

- And all I could think of to do was

- And without missing a beat, Cam says

- Casablanca.

-  All I did was this- - Casablanca.

- Casablanca.

- Can we just please get the diapers and get out of here?

- Fine, but I wanna stop by the wine section first.

- Wait. There's a wine section?

- Yeah, a really good one- just past the tires.

- No way. They do not have- Oh, my God.

- Oh, my- Cam. Cam. The paper shredder I wanted.

- Huh? Confetti and crosscut.

- Yep.

- Oh, my God. Amazing.

- Yeah.

- Cam, what is this place?

- Those cookies smell like heaven. Your own recipe?

- No, I just throw 'em in the oven.

- And added the secret ingredient of caring?

- Sure.

- So, you and Luke having a good time?

- I don't know. He won't come out of his box.

- Maybe I'll just stay here and spend some time with my sister.

- Oh, right. I guess technically I would be your stepsister.

- My mother says we are never to use the word "Step"

- Because it means "Not real."

- And we are a real family. Mmm.

- So what is the matter, Claire?

-  What? - You seem sad.

- It's just stuff with Alex.

- You know, kid stuff.

- Kids.

- You don't have to tell me. My school is full of them.

- I was thinking after lunch we can go and do a little shopping.

- I'm not getting a dress.

- I don't care. I'm not your mother.

- I know. You're my grandmother.

- Step-grandmother.

- Anyways, today, think of me as a girlfriend.

- Two girls out for an afternoon of fun.

- What do you usually do with your girlfriends?

- I don't know. We go out. We talk, drink wine.

-  Can I drink wine? - No.

- Some friend.

- Well, you can still talk to me about anything.

- Yeah, adults always say that, but they don't mean it.

- When my mom says I can ask her anything, 

- I really can't.

- She just freaks out.

- I won't freak out. Shoot.

- Okay.

- How many men have you slept with?

- Eight. Next.

-  Now can I try it? - No.

- I should get one of those. I've always loved planes.

- If things had gone a little differently in my life,

- I think I would have been a pilot.

- Hey, what would happen if you turned the remote off

- and then back on real fast?

- Yeah, you'd have been a great pilot.

- So, can you do a- Can you do a loop-de-loop?

- If I wanted to.

- No way! Can I try it?

- No.

- I can see why you like this. It's so peaceful.

- It's like the whole world just... disappears out here.

-  I remember this one summer- - I'll tell you what.

- There's another trick called "Threading the needle."

- I used to do it with Claire and Mitch when they were kids.

-  You wanna try it? - How's it go?

- You grab one of those hoops over there...

- and go to the far, far, far end of the field...

- and stand there, and I fly the plane through it.

- Um, that sounds awesome!

-  And then I get a chance flying it? - No.

- Okay.

- How's this?

- Not far enough. Go on.

-  Okay. Further down. - You can't go too far.

- Right. Okay, I get it. I get it.

-  How's this? - Good.

- Now stand still. Don't move.

- Okay, let's do it. Whoo!

- Whoo! I love it!

- I love... it!

- You drove a plane into my face.

- You must have moved. I told you to stay still.

-  I didn't move. - Try not to talk.

- I want to make sure nothing's broken.

- Alex and I can't just disagree.

- I mean, she has to turn everything into a fight.

- Hmm. A strong, independent woman.

- Sounds like somebody else I know.

- I was never hostile though.

- I mean, this whole thing with the dress

- Never had this problem with Haley.

- Maybe Alex doesn't want to compete with her big sister.

- Maybe she's trying to create her own identity.

- Put her in a dress, and she disappears.

- For one afternoon?

- I wouldn't give up being myself for even one second.

- Sometimes it's hard to remember you're only 10 years old.

-  And three-quarters. - Yeah.

- Hey, it's Mitchell. Do you guys eat olives?

- Olives?

-  Really good olives? - Yeah.

- You got it.

- Mitchell, I found the diapers. They're over here.

- Cameron, guess what I found?

- Coffins.

- They sell baby formula and they sell coffins.

- You can buy literally buy

- everything you need from birth to death.

- Oh, my God. Look at these diapers.

- Look how cheap they are!

- Oh. You know what we should do?

- We should get enough for the next year or two, right?

- Where would we keep them?

-  They sell sheds. - Really?

- You want to buy a diaper shed?

- We're those guys now? The guys with a diaper shed?

- Just grab two more.

- I'm not grabbing two more, Mitchell.

- It's time to go.

- Come on, come on. We need, uh- Hey, excuse me.

-  Where did you get that flatbed thing? - Over there.

-  Go grab one of those. - Really?

- Yeah. Get two.

- I'm in the applesauce aisle.

- So, anyways, 

- after charades, we went out for coffee.

- And I learned that he loves art.

- He plays the piano. He speaks French.

-  Un peu. - You see? 

- I-I misjudged him.

- Yeah, I'm sort of like Costco.

- I'm big, I'm not fancy, and I dare you to not like me.

- Yeah, and I'm kinda more like that, um

- What is the name of that little shop we went to in Paris?

- You are such a snob.

- Casablanca.

- I have a small flower on my ankle...

- and a tiny little butterfly on my... thigh.

- How high up?

-  Pretty high. - Did you do it to look sexy?

- No- - Did you do it for a guy? Does Grandpa like it?

- No, no and yes.

- That's gross

-  Let's go back to your piercings. - No, no, no.

- I've answered enough of your questions.

- Now it's your turn to answer one.

- What is it?

- Why you don't want to wear a dress?

- Because I don't want to look like Haley and her stupid friends.

- I wear dresses and I don't look like Haley.

- You are Haley, just 40 years older.

-  Ten. - Twenty.

- Deal. Alex, why are you fighting me on this?

- Just- It doesn't matter if I dress up.

- I'm not pretty like Haley and you.

-  That's ridiculous! You're beautiful. - I'm not.

- But that's okay. I'm the smart one.

- The cute busboy doesn't know that you're smart.

- What?

- He's been smiling at you every time he comes to the table.

- He does not!

- Why do you think we are the only people with bread?

- Look. One day you're going to want to date a cute guy like that.

- And when that day comes, you're going to want to look beautiful,

- and then you'll wear a dress.

- So, you ever kiss another girl?

- That's no way to talk to your grandmother.

- Was my mom hard on me growing up? 

- Yeah, she was.

- But you know what? Back then

- everything was Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem.

- They didn't understand

-  Hola! We're back. - Hello.

-  Hey, how'd it go? - It was great.

-  Did you have fun with Luke? - Well, not

- We had a great time.

- Alex, I've been thinking, and...

- if you don't want to wear a dress to the wedding,

- it's not the end of the world.

- It's all right. I bought one.

- Do you see how she has to provoke me?

- We'll talk about it next week.

- Claire!

- Clear the way. Coming through. Ow!

- Coming through. Easy. Easy, fella. Ow!

-  I need to rest my face. - You're fine.

- You'll be all right. Hang on.

-  Oh, my God! - Get the door.

- Ah! Dad?

- Little accident. Nothing big.

-  I was in a plane crash. - What happened?

- We were threading the needle, and somebody moved.

- No, I didn't. You did it on purpose.

- That's the painkiller talking.

- He's a little loopy.

-  How bad is it? - Well, the wing is cracked,

-  the propeller's bent, but I can- I can- - I mean Phil.

-  I was in a plane crash. - Thanks, Dad.

- I didn't ask him to be there. He insisted.

- He took a chance. This is what happened.

- Kind of like the time you ran over his foot.

- You ran over his foot?

-  That was an accident. - You know, Dad, you did it on purpose.

- We all saw the tire marks on the lawn.

- I had just quit smoking.

- See, you're upsetting your husband.

-  Water. - I'll get it.

- Ay. You okay?

- Gloria! Thank God you're here.

- Don't worry. I'm here too.

- Who's this?

- Wasn't my fault.

- I have seen you thread the needle a million times.

- You never miss.

- Yeah. I must be getting old.

- Why don't you just admit it? You never liked Phil.

- Put that down. You do not get a cookie.

- I like Phil.

- It's just that sometimes he tries too hard, you know?

- And it's just kind of- irritating.

- Okay, maybe he tries too hard

- because you make zero effort with him.

- You know what? In the 16 years that we've been married,

- have you one time told him that you liked him?

-  Not in those exact words, no. - No.

- Not in any words, Dad. 

- How do you think that makes me feel?

- You've never told your son that you love him?

- Whoa, whoa. When did we jump to love?

- And he's technically not my son.

-  Ah. So that means that you don't love Manny either? - Sure, I do.

- I mean, believe me, when I was in that park,

- I really wished Manny was there.

- For what?

- So that you could fly the plane into his head? Huh?

- Dad, thanks so much for bringing Phil home.

- I found one of your little flaps in his hair. So

- Actually, this is called an aileron.

-  It controls... - because that's what matters right now.

- Bye, Dad.

-  Hey, Phil. - Jay.

- What are you, made of china?

- Phil, I just want you to know I'm sorry.

- And whether I, uh, missed or you moved

-  I didn't. - either way.

- I just want to say that I like you.

-  Really? - Yeah.

- What do you like about me?

- You're a nice guy.

- Try real hard.

- I do.

- And you're a good dad.

- Hey, I'm a good dad. Come here.

- Come here, you.

- This feels so right.

- What's going on?

- There was a little accident,

- but Jay's telling Phil how much he loves him.

- Oh. Well, that's nice for Phil.

- That's great,

- since he's never said anything like that to my boyfriend.

-  Let it go. - No, it's not okay.

- No, Mitch is right. Go in there too, Cam. Come on.

- You're kidding.

-  Jay! - I'm gonna get this.

-  Come on in, Cam. - Just a little hug.

-  Get in here. - Say it.

-  Whoa! Hey, hey, hey! - Say it! Say it!

- I like you too, Cam.

-  What do you like about him? - Oh, jez.

- Where did you get that camera?

- Only the greatest store on earth.

- Thanks, Dad.

- Manny, picture! Get in there too.

- Get in here, mi amigo. Oh!

- Stay still. Say "Cheese."

-  Don't push it. - Cheese!

- Picture.

-  Cheese! - Cheese. Queso.

- Oh, boy!

- Doesn't it feel like these arms could go around the world?

- I think I strained something.

- I always wanted a daughter

- to dress her up in pretty dresses,

- do her hair, her nails, her makeup.

- No one knows this, but for the first year of his life,

- I made up Manny like a girl

- and told everybody that he was my daughter.

- Ay, but just for a few times.

- I didn't want to mess with his head.

- When he found the pictures,

- I told him that it was his twin sister who died.

S01E04 
----------------------
- Jay, I'm home.

- Did Manny call?

- No, because he's fine.

- It was a slumber party, not a gang fight.

- I just want him to fit in.

- I'm gonna take a shower. Do you care to join me?

- You know, honey, there's a gun in the footlocker in the garage.

- If I ever say no to that question,

- I want you to use it on me.

- Miss Mary Mack, Mack, Mack.

-  All dressed in black, black, black. - Shh, shh.

-  What's wrong? - With silver buttons, buttons, buttons.

- All down her back, back, back.

- Why aren't they trying to hurt each other?

- I don't know, but I'm afraid to move.

-  You're really good at this. - Thanks.

- What is happening, Claire?

- What do you think?

- Now, that is a scone.

- No butter. Nonfat.

- Shut up.

- I'm gonna go check on Lily.

-  Surprise! - Mom!

- What's that?

- Sounds like a bird hit the window.

- Oh, God. That's a bad sign.

- Ow! That hurt, jerk!

- Ow! I'm gonna kill you, stupid!

- What happened?

- Now I'm sad.

-  Hi, honey. Mmm! - Hi. I, uh

- I- I didn't know you were in town. You didn't call.

- Well, I couldn't wait to see your new baby. Where is she?

-  Mitchell, who was that? - It's my mom.

- Oh, yeah, right,

- 'cause the last time she was here,

- the refrigerator magnets rearranged themselves into a penta...

- Grandma!

- Mom. Mom, what are you doing to her legs?

- Tai chi. I did it every day in Sedona.

- Cameron, you should try it.

- Mitchell's mother has a problem...

- with me.

- Last Christmas, for example,

- she gave me a piece of exercise equipment and a lettuce dryer.

- So, to recap,

- I gave her a gorgeous pair of diamond earrings,

- and she gave me a hint.

- And living in Sedona has been transformational.

- I get up every morning, and I go to a Vortex meditation site...

- and work with a shaman to

- finally understand how to live my spirituality.

- Yikes.

- And I've learned that

- the only way I can move to the next level of my awakening...

- is if we all can somehow...

- get past...

- the incident.

- Oh, no.

- The incident.

- Oh, boy.

- I would like to congratulate Jay and the lovely Gloria.

- I'm very happy for them.

- I wanted a big, beautiful wedding with Jay...

- because my ex-husband and I got married...

- in a tiny little office of a judge in Colombia.

- My mother wanted to go to the wedding

- to show everyone how okay she was with all of it,

- so I convinced Dad and Gloria to invite her.

- Who warned you that that was the worst idea ever?

- Anyone?

- Anyone?

- Of course, I've-I've moved on.

- I was supposed to come with a date,

- but he just hurt his back,

- which is very ironic because he's young and-and healthy.

- My mom started drinking...

- these cocktails called "Horny Colombians"...

- with some of Gloria's uncles,

- whom apparently the drink was named after.

- Oh, come on. They were funny.

- They kept patting my butt.

- Somebody's full of herself.

- It's a- It's a Colombian wedding tradition, they said.

- I would like to make a toast.

- Yeah. Nanna got totally wasted.

- Uh, it was really funny.

- Then it was gross.

- To the bride and the groom- my ex.

- Thirty-five years we were together,

- and he couldn't wait 10 minutes to run off with Charo.

- That's a joke.

- Seriously, I knew they were perfect for each other...

- when I saw his wallet and her boobs.

- Take your hands off me!

-  Mom. Mom. - Oh, relax, Mitchell.

- What, did you take your Claire pill?

-  No, no. - Let's just go get a little fresh air, okay?

- And then it got weird.

-  I'm Gloria! I'm Gloria! - I got her.

- Kiss me! Oh, hey, kiss me!

- No! Oh, geez.

- Nanna is really strong.

- Ayayayayay! Ooh! Ayayayayay!

- During my vows to my first husband,

- drug dealers burst in and assassinated the judge.

- This was way worse.

- What can I say? I drive women crazy.

- It's too soon, I guess.

- Everybody is going to be there, Mom!

- I don't care.

- Your father and I are not about to let you

- drive two hours to go to a concert...

- and then spend the night with a bunch of boys,

- especially that 17-year-old hormone you're dating.

- It's totally supervised.

- Oh, really? By whom?

- By Spencer Patine's uncle.

- Who's Spencer Patine?

- You know Spencer- the guy with the arm.

- Wait. What kind of arm?

- What is that even mean?

- His uncle is Uncle Toby.

- Oh, Uncle Toby. I'll be sure to include that in my Amber Alert.

-  Oh, my God! - Okay. Can I step in here?

- I think I can help.

- Haley, what your mom is worried about...

- is you getting your heart broken

- when Dylan goes off to college next year.

-  He's not going to college. - That's not what I'm

- He's not going to college?

- He's in a band, okay? They're going on tour.

- Oh, this just gets better and better.

- Why are you always on me about everything?

-  Because you need to understand... - Okay. Everybody, calm down!

- Let's start from the beginning.

- What's wrong with Spencer's arm?

- Mom, I'm home!

- Ay, baby! Did you have fun at the slumber party?

- You must be exhausted.

- No, I'm not tired at all.

- I was the first one to fall asleep.

- What's on your face?

- A smile from having such a good time with my friends.

- No. Come here.

- Look.

- That's why they were laughing.

- I thought it was my funny take on current events.

- Why would they do something like that?

- Don't worry about it.

- Guys pull pranks like that all the time.

- You just gotta prank 'em back.

- You just gotta show 'em

- you're willing to give as good as you get.

- What do you think?

- Revenge.

- I like it.

- Well, Mom, instead of dredging up the whole incident,

- maybe we should just try and repress it,

- like a- like a normal family.

- I can't. I need closure.

- I'm about to embark on a new journey.

- I met a man.

- Really?

- His name is Chas,

- and he's asked me to come live with him in his foreign land.

- Wow. Where?

- Canada.

- You're moving to-to Canada?

- French Canada.

- That's wonderful.

- It is wonderful.

- It's just that when I think of all the awful things...

- that I said to Gloria and Jay and you and Claire,

- I feel such guilt.

- Give it time, and see Banff.

- Cam, please.

- I just can't give myself to him sexually.

-  Okay. Mom. - Did not see that coming.

- Oh, oh. Don't get me wrong.

- We satisfy each other down there

-  Oh! Can't.. - Don't wanna

- That's why I need everyone's forgiveness.

- I need your help, Mitchell.

- Did you hear that, Mitchell?

- Your mom needs your help to make love to her new man, Chas.

- That's not weird at all.

- Mom, I

- I'm just not really sure what you're asking me to do, Mom.

- Well, everyone's mad at me.

- Maybe you could pave the way so that I can apologize.

- Well, um, you know,

- we are actually all supposed to have Sunday dinner tonight,

- so maybe I could go around and ask everyone

- if it's okay for you to join us.

- Oh! I knew I could count on you.

- Oh, my beautiful boy. Mmm.

- I love you so much.

- There's a fish in nature

- that swims around with its babies in its mouth.

- That fish would look at Mitchell's relationship with his mother...

- and say, "that's messed up."

- Boy

- Things with your mom got pretty intense down there, huh?

- All like East Coast-West Coast. You feelin' me?

- Act like a parent, talk like a peer.

- I call it "Peerenting."

- I learned it from my own dad, who used to walk into my room...

- and say, "what's up, sweathog?"

- Honey, I would love to let you go to the concert.

- Are you kidding me? I think concerts are rad.

- Hello? I was a Hall-Raiser.

- A what?

- I followed Hall & Oates around the country one summer.

- "Rich Girl" Just spoke to me.

- I was dating this girl. Not- Not dating.

- I guess I was following her too, kind of

- Okay, Mom just doesn't trust me, and it's not fair.

- She trusts you. It's just that weird stuff happens at concerts.

-  Boys get urges. - Ew.

- Dad, is there something you want?

- Yes, there is- to connect with this girl right here.

- Now, come on. Pretend I'm not your dad.

- We're just a couple of friends kickin' it in a juice bar.

- What's a juice bar?

- Okay, a malt shop. Whatever.

-  Dad, I don't... - No. Who's Dad?

- Who's Dad? I'm- I'm Marcus from Biology.

- Hey, Haley. How's it going with you and Dylan?

- Has he tried anything inappropriate with you?

- Girl.

- Hey.

-  What are you doing? - I don't know. Nothing.

- Just talking to some dork I met in a malt shop.

- Hey, Mitchell. What's up?

- Hey! Just in the hood.

- Do you- Do you remember how Mom gave up a career to raise us?

- Promising career.

- Oh, God.

- Claire?

- Mom.

- Why so long?

- I know, I know. It's weird when we haven't talked for a while.

- I mean your hair.

- Well, if I can't tell you, who will?

- So, Mom wants you to know

- that she's very sorry about the incident,

- and-and she wants us to forgive her.

- How very nice of her to say that through you.

- Do you see?

- The sarcasm is so hurtful, like a whip.

- You know how growing up,

- we all have that voice inside our head...

- that tells us we're not good enough?

- Well, mine was outside my head,

- driving me to school.

- Uh, so- so anyway,

- Mom really wants to smooth everything over with Dad and Gloria.

- So I was thinking, uh, would it be okay

- if she maybe joined us for dinner tonight?

- Because it may be the last time you ever see me.

-  Well... - Okay. Wait, Mom.

- What are you talking about?

- Well, I'm- I'm moving...

- to a far and dangerous place.

- Canada. But, uh, she met a man named Chas.

-  Yeah. - He's a logger.

- Uh, like a lumberjack?

- No, he logs blood samples into a cholesterol study.

- Anyway, until I'm past this whole wedding debacle,

- I can't be intimate with him.

- We do things to each other.

-  We use our hands. - Oh, my Lord.

- Hey, Nanna.

- Oh, my little comet!

- Oh, look at you. You're all grown up.

- Hmm. Tell Mom that.

- She won't even let me go to a concert.

- Overnight, with her boyfriend.

- What are you laughing at?

- Oh, karma's a funny thing, that's all.

-  Remember Ricky? - Oh, God.

- Ooh. Who's Ricky?

- No one.

- Ricky was your mother's boyfriend,

- and he looked like Charles Manson.

- And one night, she didn't come home until 4:00 in the morning.

- 4:00. Wow. Wow. Mom, what were you and Ricky doing?

- Nothing. We were doing nothing,

- and he was a very sweet boy,

- which you might have known if you bothered to get to know him.

- Dylan's a sweet boy.

- Dylan. Dylan isn't Ricky.

- Ricky- Ricky was a poet.

- Dylan writes songs.

- Awesome songs.

- And maybe you would know that

- "If you bothered to get to know him."

- Okay, you know? First of all, I am not my mother.

- I don't judge people before I get a chance to know them.

- So you invite Dylan over to dinner tonight,

- and if he's as sweet and as kind as you say he is,

- then I have no problem considering letting you go to the concert,

- after I do a background check on Uncle Toby.

- Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mom.

- I'm gonna go call him!

- That's very revealing.

- That's my parenting style.

-  No, I meant your blouse. - Mom!

- Claire, wait. Come...

- Not making this easy.

- Claire, come on. Stop, stop, stop.

- Just let her come to dinner, apologize to Dad and Gloria,

- and she and Chas can live happily ever after.

-  In Canada. - In Canada.

- Wait. Why don't you make her fix this,

- instead of you doing it as usual?

- Whoa. What's that supposed to mean?

- Mom makes a mess, and there's Mitchell to clean it up.

- That is so not true.

- If anything,

- you're the one with the screwed-up relationship with Mommy

-  With Mom. - Wow.

-  "Mommy"! - No, I didn't say it

-  Damn it. - Ooh. Fine. Fine.

-  She can come, but she's gotta clear it with Daddy. - "Daddy"?

-  I did not say "Daddy." - You said "Daddy."

- Hey, Dad.

- Mitchell, what are you doing here?

- Uh, I'm sorry to bother you.

- Can I talk to you and Gloria for a second?

- She's out dealing with a Manny situation.

- He set a kid's bike on fire.

- Why?

- Oh, I might have told him to get even with some kids,

- and he went all Rambo with it.

- Not my best parenting moment.

- Not your worst.

- What's up?

-  Uh, well, you know, uh, Mom's in town. - Your mom?

- No, your mom. She's back from the grave.

- Yes. Yes, my mom, Dad.

- My mom would be less scary.

- Listen, she's a wreck about what happened at the wedding,

- and she wants to come to dinner tonight to apologize to everyone.

- Still her little errand boy, I see.

- No- Why does everybody keep saying- No.

- I- I'm just trying to piece this family back together.

- So, you'll talk to Gloria about Mom coming to dinner?

- Oh, Gloria would never go for that in a million years.

- She's still furious with your mother,

- which is why I'm not talking to you.

- What did I do?

- This conversation never took place.

- That's not very nice.

- I drove all the way here.

- No, you didn't. You were never here.

- You never even called.

- I would've called,

- but I thought it would be better

- What's happening here?

- Listen, I would love to get this thing behind us,

- but Gloria would never forgive me

- if I pulled a fast one on her.

- That's why you're going to pull a fast one on her,

- and I'm not going to like it one bit.

- Okay, that's just great.

- No, that's great. So, it's all up to me.

- I can't hear you because you're back home, and I'm taking a nap.

-  D-Money! There he is. - Hey.

-  Come on in. - Hey.

-  Hi. - How you doing?

- Good.

- Um- Uh, hey, everybody.

-  This is Dylan. - Hey.

-  Hi, Dylan. - Hey.

- He has a very gentle soul.

- You got that from "Hey"?

- So, Dylan, see you brought the ax.

-  Yeah, yeah. I just came from practice. - Sweet.

- Miss those days.

- Oh, you were in a band?

- Could have been, but in high school

- I was really all about my magic, so

- Oh, my God. Over.

- Oh, that's gonna be Dad and Gloria.

- Oh, Mitchell.

- I know it's silly, but...

- I'm a little nervous.

- Oh. That's not silly. You should be.

-  Hola. Hola. - How are you?

-  Manny? - Phil.

-  Nice mustache. - Thank you.

- Don't make fun. He may burn your house down.

- Oh, boy.

- Dede.

- Hi, Jay, Gloria.

- What is she doing here?

- What does she mean, "What is she doing here?"

-  Mitchell told you I'd be here. - Lies!

- I couldn't tell her, because she wouldn't come.

- Gloria, uh, my mom wants to apologize for everything.

- So you just spring it on Gloria like this?

- Mitchell, what the hell is wrong with you?

- I don't want her apologies.

- Who could blame you, honey?

- Which is why this is a terrible idea by you!

- Jay. Manny. Let's go.

- Oh, wait, wait, Gloria.

- I- I just want to tell you

- how sorry I am for ruining your wedding.

- I was struggling with being alone.

- Meanwhile, Jay moves on so easily,

- and-and not with just anyone

- with a...

- young...

- and smart and beautiful woman.

- I don't expect you to forgive me.

- If I were you, I'd want to punch me right in the mouth.

- I think we've had enough revenge in this family for one day.

- Ah. Okay. Y- You see?

- Yeah, we're all gonna move past this, and because of me,

- who's not a mama's boy, but is

- a caring person with wisdom and emotional insight.

- So make a note, bitches.

- It's not a good color on you.

- I forgive you.

- I am not prepared for this.

- I just

- I- I wanna

-  rip your head off! - What?

- What are you doing?

-  You ruined my wedding! - Oh, no!

- Oh! I got Gloria!

-  I got Gloria! - Mom, come on.

- Unbend your legs.

- I got Gloria.

- Stand up like a big girl. Come on.

- All right. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it, the two of you.

-  I am so sorry about this. - No, it's cool. It's cool.

- This is ridiculous. Gloria didn't steal me,

- Dede, and you know it.

- We grew apart for years,

- and you left to find yourself, remember?

- I thought I could handle this.

- I'm so sorry.

- You don't say sorry anymore!

-  That word means nothing in your mouth! - I got Gloria.

- I don't know what just happened.

- I do.

- I mean, it seems pretty simple to me.

- You're reaching out, trying to hold on to something awesome.

- Um, maybe- maybe you shouldn't...

- Look, look, look. I'm not used to this

- the whole big family thing.

- In my house, we don't even talk to each other.

- You know, it's funny- the first time I saw Haley,

- I knew I liked her.

- I mean, she's beautiful and everything,

- but it's-it's not just that.

- It's that she's got this killer confidence

- you know, the kind of confidence

- that you get from having a family like this...

- that's passionate...

- and accepting of hot foreigners...

- and gay dudes and nutty people.

- You know,

- a family that actually loves each other.

- I can't believe I'm gonna say this,

- but maybe we should let her go with him.

- He's perfect.

- Everybody, Haley says that Dylan is a musician,

- and he writes some great songs.

-  Yeah. - Play something, bro.

- Well, I guess so, if you want me to.

- We could all use a nice tune right now.

- This is, uh, actually a song I wrote for Haley.

- It's called "In the Moonlight."

-  Lovely title, Dylan. - Thanks.

- *The stars are falling from the sky*

- *And you're the reason why*

S01E05 
----------------------
- Let's go, buddy. Schooltime.

- Oh, and Gloria, if you want to get together with the girls later,

- I could just, you know, watch the football game or something.

- That means he wants to watch a football game.

- I'm not talking to you.

- What are you drinking coffee for anyway?

- It's my culture. I'm Colombian.

- Oh, yeah? What part of Colombia

- are those French toaster sticks from?

- Babe, I'm not sure about the game.

- The whole family's coming over for the barbecue.

-  That's today? - See.

- It's the Ohio State game.

- So? Everybody can watch.

- I don't like watching the game with people who don't know the game.

- People talk.

- You talk at my football games.

- For one thing, it's called soccer.

- Your team scored two goals all season.

- I'm not taking a big risk.

- How much of this did you drink?

- Give me a break. I have to climb a rope today.

-  Hey, Mom. - Yeah?

- Can I have $40 for lunch?

- Forty dollars?

-  I also need a book for school. - What book?

- I want a dress.

- Do you have any idea what a bad liar you are?

- I'd be more worried that

- she couldn't come up with a single book title.

- Luke, come on. We're late.

- Mmm, there's a first- inside out and backwards.

- At least it isn't zipped into his...

- Oh. There it is.

- Well, there's book smart, and then there's street smart.

- Yeah, and then there's Luke.

- Oh, he's just... He's just curious. That's all.

- He's got this almost scientific mind...

- with a thirst for knowledge.

- He's like this little Einstein.

- Some people ask, "Why?"

- Luke asks, "Why not?"

- I ask "Why?" a lot.

- We're at the ten. We're at the five.

- We're at the one. Daddy, we're scoring a touchdown!

- No, please... please don't spike our baby.

- Why is she dressed like the Hamburglar?

- She's a referee.

- Do... Do we even have to go to my dad's tonight?

- Are you kidding me? We're playing Ohio State.

- I collect antique fountain pens.

- I'm quite adept at Japanese flower arrangement

- ikebana

- and I was a starting offensive lineman at the University of Illinois.

- Surprise.

-  I don't like football. - You know what?

- I thought part of being in a relationship...

- was pretending to enjoy your partner's interests.

- Do you think I really loved home pickle-making?

- Yeah, 'cause you did.

- For a week, 

- until we became the weird guys who gave everybody pickles.

- Oh, thank you, Marvin, for inviting us into your lovely home.

- Here. Would you care for a sack of pickles?

- It was charming.

- We were picklers, Mitchell.

- Okay, you know what? Fine.

- Stay home with your little jagged scissors.

- Maybe catch up on your scrapbooking.

- Come... You loved scrapbooking.

- Did I, Mitchell? Did I?

- Stop. Don't do the "Double question to prove a point" thing.

- I hate it when people do that.

- Do you, Mitchell? Do you?

- Stop, Lily.

- No problem. We'll be right down. Thanks.

- Hey, honey. What's up?

- The school just called. Luke got in a fight.

- Oh, geez. Is he okay?

- Yeah, he's fine, but they want us to come down there.

-  Where are you? - I'm showing a house.

- What house?

- I'm golfing.

- I bet it was that Durkas kid.

- I hate that kid.

- He probably jumped on Luke

- and Luke just fought back.

-  Kid's a menace. - He made fun of my hair once.

- Shh. The parents are probably in there.

- I slept on it funny.

- Like that never happened to him?

- Come on.

- What are you doing here?

- These two knuckleheads were fighting each other.

-  What? - Could've been worse.

- I was not ready to face Durkas today.

- So what happened?

- Well, apparently there was some name-calling

- and shoving on the playground.

- By the time a teacher separated them,

- Luke was sitting on Manny's chest.

-  Luke, that's not like you. - Wait a minute.

-  You're Luke's father? - Grandfather.

-  So Manny's father is... - Javier.

- Crazy guy. That's where he gets his fire.

-  Okay, you're... - He's our son.

-  And my grandson. - I'm his daughter.

-  So you're... - His uncle.

- Stop saying that or I'll sit on your chest again.

- Ho! Wait a second. Is that what this was all about?

- He keeps calling me his nephew.

- You are my nephew.

-  Shut up! - Okay, okay.

- I'm getting the sense that you're all related, uh, somehow.

- So it's probably best if you work this out at home...

- so the boys can go back to class, okay?

- But we're not happy about this, boys.

- This is not how mature young men behave.

- Here's your note for Miss Passwater.

- Look, I wouldn't worry. They're good kids.

- It's just tough when one kid's a little different.

-  Yes. - Yes.

- You heard how she said that, right?

- "Yes."

- She thought Luke was the weird one. Luke.

- Her kid gets his head stuck in the furniture,

- and Manny is the different one.

- I will tell you what's weird.

- Our son is not weird.

- What's weird is that her kid wears aftershave

- and dresses like a count.

- I think we should cancel with them for the barbecue.

- If we cancel, it'll just make this a bigger deal than it is.

- It'll be good for Luke and Manny to spend some time.

-  Might be good for you and Gloria too. - Why?

- She's always had a problem with me.

- I think I'm gonna find out what it is.

- That's the worst thing you could do.

- Just sweep it under the rug.

-  I'm not a sweeper. - Trust me on this.

- I think you two need to talk it out.

- I don't have anything to say to her.

- She's the one with the problem, not me.

- Whose side are you on?

- She's my daughter. You're my wife.

- Let's remember what's important here.

- There's a football game on.

- I just hate it when my two girls aren't getting along.

- How exactly is she your girl?

- I got a few things for the party.

- Is Lily ready to go?

- Oh, yeah, yeah. She's ready.

- What's wrong?

- I'm just really worried about C.J. Hightower.

- With the bad ankle,

- I don't know how he's gonna run his corner routes.

- What did my boyfriend just say?

- Listen, I heard what you said, and I thought, yes,

- I should try to learn more about football.

- That is very mature of you.

- I figure, if football fans can learn it,

- how hard can it be?

- That's very elitist of you.

- I'm taking baby steps here, all right?

- I'm actually- I'm really looking forward to it.

- 'Cause it's not just the game.

- It's-It's the bands and the drama, the pageantry.

- Don't forget about the team mascots.

- They wear ascots?

- No. Mascots. With an "M."

- That could have been very embarrassing.

- Okay.

- Am I straight?

- I'm not sure what you are right now.

- How ya doin'?

-  Hey, Gramps. - Hi, beautiful.

- Hi, Phil. Good to see ya.

- Let me guess. Game's on?

- Just started.

- Hey. For you.

- It's nice to see you, Gloria.

- Ah! Two times today.

-  Okay, well... - Uh, Phil?

- She means we've seen them two times today.

- Okay, everybody, the food's in there. The drinks are in there.

-  I'll be in here. - Hold on, Jay.

- I think we should address the elephant in the room.

- Uh, Luke, Manny. Bring it in.

- Come on. Huddle up.

- Football.

- Now in light of what happened at school today,

- do you have any feelings you'd like to express?

- I think this is the proper forum...

- For god's sakes. All right, both of you.

- Now, in this family, do we kick and punch each other,

- or do we love each other?

- Love each other. That's right.

- I'II be in the den.

- So, I brought dessert.

- Okay. Thank you.

- I make pie too.

- You can never have too many pies, right?

- Okay, whoa. Whoa.

- Everybody take a deep breath.

- Let's think about getting real.

- Phil, no.

- Why "Phil, no"?

- What is Phil doing?

- I'm just gonna say it.

- There's tension between you two.

- Bam. It's out there. 

- I'm gonna kill you.

- I think he's right, and I think we should talk about it.

- That's what I'm talkin' about...

- you two talking... about it.

- I like football.

- Haley hates it, which is weird

- because it's all boys... and there's no reading required.

- Do you know that she spends

- at least 45 minutes every morning doing her hair?

- And then sometimes...

- Let's go, Illini!

- Let's go! Right now!

- Looks like I gotta watch the game with Dick Butkus.

- Dad! Dad, come on. That's offensive.

- Mitchell, he's one of the greatest linebackers

- to ever play at Illinois...

- and one of my personal heroes.

- And his name is "Butt-kiss"?

- We're just choosing to...

- Okay. All right.

- Dad, I thought you were being homophobic. I'm sorry.

-  We got all night. - Yes, we do.

-  Are you joining us here? - Yeah.

- Jay, you know what? He's been studying up.

- I gotta tell ya, I'm a little worried about C.J. Hightower.

- Right? With the bad ankle?

- I'm wondering how he's gonna run his corner routes.

-  Hightower's out. - What?

- Oh. Then who is gonna run the corner routes?

- I'll tell you who it won't be- Billings.

- That's low. He's in jail.

- Oh, wow. Yeah. Then no.

- Double tight end,

- it's gonna be a quarterback roll-out to the left.

-  They're gonna run it. - No, trust me.

- He's got the slot.

- In the end zone! Touchdown!

- Lucky call. Maybe they, uh, should've considered blitzing.

- Blitzing wouldn't have helped them. Get outta here.

- Oh, gosh. Blitzing.

- So, my interest in football ended as suddenly and dramatically...

- as the climax of West Side Story.

- I'm a musical theater fan.

- Surprise.

- Okay. The truth?

- I sometimes feel like you don't like me.

- Powerful, powerful stuff.

- Claire? Tell us how that makes you feel.

- Right now, I'm feeling a lot of anger.

- No, don't tell me. Tell her.

- Gloria, right now, I'm really angry at Phil.

- Let's respect the process.

- Gloria, I don't know

- why you think I don't like you.

- Sometimes when you see me, you make that face. 

- What face?

- Like this. 

-  I do not make a face like that. - Oh, my God.

-  That is so Claire. - Mitchell!

- See? She does that with everyone.

- It's just her face.

- No, it's not just the face.

- From the beginning,

- I feel like Manny and I are not welcome in this family.

- That is so crazy.

- No, it's not so crazy. It's how I feel.

- I am sorry if you feel that way.

- I really am, because from the moment I met you,

- I have tried to make you feel comfortable with us.

- You think it's all in my head?

- No. Kind- I don't know.

- I mean, we really love having you and Manny in our family.

-  Really? - Really.

- So, you don't have to be so defensive.

- I do that, don't I?

- Well, a bit.

- I'm feeling a hug.

- I was thinking group hug,

-  But this is nice. - I'd be there if I could.

- Oh, my God. There's hugging.

- Haley, get off the phone already.

- Where did you go?

- You heard him.

- He said, "Get outta here."

- Oh, my God. You're such a girl.

- Dad- I was coming to get a beer anyways.

- Nice apology. 

- Nice beer.

- Hey, there are the little roustabouts.

-  You look like you patched things up pretty good, huh? - Yeah.

- Oh, we can learn so much from the children.

- Bet it seems kind of silly now

- what you were even fighting about, huh?

-  I made fun of his accent. - What accent?

- I made fun of him for having the same thing for lunch every day.

- I made fun of him because his mom used to dig coal.

- What?

- He said you were a coal digger.

- Okay. I think we can move on.

- Who said I was a coal digger?

- That's what my mom told me.

- What's a coal digger?

- Sweetheart, he heard it wrong.

- It's "Gold digger."

- I'm gonna have to call you back.

- I really do not think that I remember ever saying that.

- Well, you said in the car.

- You said it at Christmas.

-  You said it in the Mexican restaurant- - Okay, 

- Mr. "Leaves His Sweatshirts at School Every Day...

- Suddenly Remembers Everything," Thank you.

- And it was all in my head, huh?

- Oh, listen. Gloria, it was...

- like, a year ago, before I knew you.

- Nice going. 

- Now my mom and my sister are fighting.

- If I say something that everybody else is thinking,

- does that make me a mean person?

- Or does it make me a brave person?

- One who is courageous enough to 

- stand up and-and say something...

- behind someone's back

- to a 10-year-old.

- Well, she's pissed.

- Yeah. She wouldn't even come out of her room.

- Did you really have to call her that- a gold digger?

- Well, you know what, Dad? It was a year ago.

- And it was a natural question to ask.

- She's a beautiful, hot woman,

- and you're not exactly, you know

- Not exactly what?

- Um- Mitchell, little help?

- No. You are doing great.

- See, this is exactly why we sweep things under the rug

- so people don't get hurt.

- Yeah, until you sweep too much under the rug.

- Then you got a lumpy rug.

- Creates a tripping hazard. You open yourself up to lawsuits.

- Boy, you can go a really long time without blinking.

- Gloria? It's Phil.

- Can I talk to you for a second?

- Claire likes to say you can be part of the problem...

- or part of the solution.

- But I happen to believe that you can be both.

- Listen, Claire feels terrible.

- Why don't you talk to her?

- Why? I know what she thinks- a coal digger.

- You know she's saying "Gold digger"? 

- Yes, Phil!

- Well, I-I know she said that.

- But that was a long time ago,

- before she knew you. 

- Does Jay buy me nice things?

- Yes! Of course! All beautiful things.

- Look at this- yellow, red, blue.

- All the colors.

- Do you think I can't live without this? 

- Take them away, Phil.

- Gloria, 

- we all know you'd be fine without underwear.

- I mean, we know it's not about that.

- No. It's about me not being accepted by my new family.

- That is not true. 

- Gloria, look, you're a beautiful woman.

- In fact, you're probably one of those

- beautiful women who doesn't even know it.

- No, I know it.

- So it's natural 

- for Claire to wonder about you and her dad.

- This family's very protective of each other.

- I remember the first time Claire brought me home.

- Do you think Jay thought I was good enough for his little girl?

- No way. But over time,

- he realized that I loved Claire as much as he did.

- And by then, Mitch had brought Cam home,

- so I was golden.

- Claire just needs a little time.

- And then, trust me,

- she'll be the most loyal friend you've ever had.

- You're not leaving, are you?

- You know, there's kind of a lot of drama.

-  So we're torn. - Let me ask you something.

- Your sister said that Gloria

- would never go for anybody who looked like me.

- Now, you guys basically are like women.

- You know, you look at guys.

- So what do you think?

- You're seriously asking us if you're attractive?

- Well, I know I'm no Erik Estrada or anything.

-  I'm just curious is all. - Dad.

- So if I was in one of your bars and

- Righteous Brothers were on, you know.

- Would you, uh,

- I don't know, check me out?

- Dad, you're really close to ruining gay for me.

-  All right, fine. Whatever. - Jay. Jay, now listen.

- I think it's- I just think it's

- a little weird for a son to say this to his father.

- But for the record, I think you're smokin' hot. 

- Really?

- Yeah, 100%. You're totally my type.

- You're dangerous, you're getable,

- you have a little "Cashola" In your pocket.

- Face, body, the whole

- The whole kit and caboodle, I think. Really.

-  What about a seven? Nine. For sure, nine.

-  But you knew that. - I might have lowballed a little bit.

- Okay, isn't there a game on?

-  Touchy. - I know.

- Gloria? Come on, let's- let's talk about this.

- I've seen her kick in a door before.

- I don't know what my husband is saying to you or...

- why he's covered in your underwear.

- Obviously I'm trying to seduce him for his money.

- 'Cause that's what I do, right?

- What do I have to give back...

- so that everyone trusts me? Huh?

-  These earrings? - No.

-  What? This bracelet? - No.

-  My new dress? - No.

- I didn't respond because...

- this shouldn't be about me.

- It should be about you...

- talking to you... about it.

- Phil? Honey?

- No, no, no. No.

- You're welcome.

- I don't know what to say

- except for that I am really, really sorry.

- Just tell me one thing.

- How do you really feel that I'm with your father?

- Uh, well

- Honestly, at first, it was hard.

- I mean, you don't expect to wake up one morning...

- with a new mom who looks like she fell off a mud flap.

- But... I'm getting used to it.

- And the important thing is you make him happy,

- which you do in- in so many ways,

- so many colors.

- Are we okay?

-  No. - No?

- You embarrassed me in front of everyone downstairs.

- What, I'm supposed just to forget about it?

- What do you want me to do- 

- just embarrass myself so we're even?

- Go jump in the pool. 

- Oh, you mean go jump in a lake. Right.

- Go jump in the pool with your clothes on.

- Then I know you're sorry.

- I'm not gonna do that, Gloria.

- Okay. Then I won't forgive you.

- Now a field goal beats us.

- Hey, you guys work that out?

- Almost. Gloria just wants me to jump in the pool.

-  Okay then. - What?

- If they could get a pass rush on 'em, something, a break.

- This is so awesome.

- I know. Mom does not look good wet.

- Gloria, is this really necessary?

- Dad, it's fine. It's fine. If I need to jump in this water...

- to prove to Gloria how sorry I am, I will do it.

- I'm fine.

- You're serious? You're not gonna stop me?

- Why would I do that?

- Because I am standing here.

- I am showing you my willingness to

- No?

-  Are you happy? - Yes! I forgive you!

- Then give me your hand.

- Oh, that's the oldest trick in the book.

-  She's gonna pull you in there. - No!

- And that's my job.

- This is funny, but this is also a teaching moment.

-  Yeah! - Think about...No!

- Cannonball!

- The snap! Fumble!

- How could he fumble that?

- Center blew the snap. 

- You know what?I hate that.

- I played center,

- and I always got blamed for a quarterback's clumsy hands.

- Well, I was a quarterback, and it was probably your fault.

- It's impossible to fumble the ball...

- when the quarterback has the proper hand placement.

- It's weird to think of a woman being sexually attracted to Dad.

- No, you wanna hear weird?

- Cam said he'd pick up dad at a gay bar.

- Ooh. How did that come up?

- Mmm, I'm really trying to block it out.

- As far as I'm concerned, 

- Mom and Dad had sex two times.

- Agreed.

- Okay, get your hands up there

- like you're lifting me off the ground.

- Be one with me, Jay. There you go.

- Do you wanna get something to eat? 

- I am never eating again.

- Just snap the damn thing.

- Perfect. That one kinda hurt.

S01E06 
----------------------
- Okay, your brother's lunch is packed.

- You're buying your own lunch.

- Luke, Alex, come on. Let's go.

- There he is. Last chance for the summer handshake.

- Dad.

- Come on. We're only halfway done.

- I need help.

- I was supposed to keep a journal all summer. It's due today.

- Wow, first day of school and you're already behind?

- I'm dead.

- All right. Tell me how far you've gotten.

- Okay.

- "June 21. Found a stick."

- "June 22." That's it.

-  That's it? - It was a really cool stick.

- He's right. It looked like a snake.

- Getting everybody out of the house in the morning

- can be really tough,

- especially the first day of school.

- From the minute we get up at 7:00

- till we drop 'em off at school, it is go, go, go.

- I get up at 6:00.

- I get up at 5:00.

- Seriously. I get up at 6:00.

- That's you? I thought we had a raccoon.

- I can't believe my little boy is going into the fifth grade.

- He used to hold my finger with his little hand

- and look at me with those big eyes.

- Mi nio pequeo, Jay.

- Yup, they grow up.

- Come on, Manny. Let's get going.

- How's my hair?

- Hold on. What are you wearing there?

- That looks like an old Christmas tree skirt.

- It's a traditional Colombian poncho.

- I want my new classmates to know

- I'm proud of my heritage.

- I think you look very handsome. Lindo.

- Oh, really? Am I driving him to school

- or is he gonna ride his burro?

- *You are a cutie pie, yes, you are*

- *You are a cutie pie*

- Are you still baby-proofing?

- Everything we own is pointy.

- Why is our daughter dressed like Donna Summer?

- She is not Donna Summer.

- Clearly she's Diana Ross from the R.C.A. Years.

- How is daddy not seeing that?

- I really thought you were done with this.

- I made no such promises.

-  I guess I'm somewhat of a shutterbug. - Yes.

- And my new favorite model, of course, is Lily.

- I just completed a series of photographs

- of her dressed as various pop icons.

- Let's see.

- I've done Olivia Newton-John.

- I've done Madonna, the early years,

- Stevie Wonder

- Yeah, there are days when Lily has more costume changes than Cher.

- Cher! How could I forget Cher?

- That's embarrassing.

- That's embarrassing?

- Honey, you moving out?

- Five more years.

- A little help here?

- This is why we suggested the violin.

- A cello is more in demand in university orchestras.

-  You know what's not in demand? - Oh, what?

- Girls who play in university orchestras.

-  Here, I'll help you carry it out to the curb. - Okay. Here.

- Phil, put on some pants.

- Come on! This covers up more than my bathing suit.

- And don't remind me.

- Haley, honey

- Don't forget, the driving instructor is picking you up from school.

- Can't he pick me up someplace else?

- I don't want kids at school thinking I'm dating...

- a 40-year-old driving instructor who's not even cute.

- Haley just got her learner's permit.

- We've been taking turns driving with her.

- One of the really standard rules of the road...

- is we want to keep a safe distance

- between us and the car in front.

-  And that is not safe right there. Not safe. - Right.

-  Okay, merge. - I

- Merge. Merge! Merge! Merge! Merge!

- Stop it! You're freaking me out!

- This navigation system is all messed up.

- It thinks we're in a park.

- Oh, my God! It is a park!

-  Away from the kids! - Oh, my God!

-  Aim for the lake! - I wanted

- Makes you realize we're all just hanging by a thread.

- The last thing Manny needs on his first day of school...

- is you "undermelting" his confidence.

-  Undermining. - Now you're doing it to me too.

- I'm sorry,

- but there's only two places anyone should wear a poncho

- Niagara Falls and log rides.

- You think too much about these things.

- I wear all sort of daring outfits all the time,

- and people admire them because I wear them with the confidence.

- Yeah, I'm sure it's the confidence they're admiring.

- I just- i just think it's a little over-the-top.

- You know what? You need to loosen up and have fun.

- I am loose. I'm fun.

- Remember, uh, breakfast for dinner last week?

- My idea.

- Ever since we brought Lily home, you've been tense.

- All you do is put child locks on things, read parenting books.

- Would you please stop and- Here, just hold your daughter.

- Hold her and relax.

-  All right, sweetheart, come on. - Just relax.

- Aw, sweetheart.

- Did you put hair spray on this?

- Just a little bit. I'm gonna put some music on.

- No, Cam, I have to go to work.

-  Dance with her. - Come on, it's not time for this.

- Put a little boogie in it.

- Oh, come on.

- Just dance. You know you love this song.

- This is actually a really good song.

- All right. Okay.

- Who's a dancing queen, huh?

- Put a little boogie in it.

- See? Fun, right?

- Oh, my- Was that her head?

- No, I think if it was her head, she would be

- Yeah, it was her head. Okay. Okay.

- Yes. Yes, I know.

- I got Boo-boo Bear from the freezer.

- Why do you have chocolate on your face?

- It was under a pie.

- So you ate your way to it?

- I made a judgment call. You weren't there.

-  Do you think she's all right? - She didn't cry that much.

- Maybe that's a bad sign. You know,

- we should try and make her laugh.

-  Why? - 'Cause that's how we'll know she's okay.

- Where's... uh... where's Doggy?

- Doggy. Doggy. Here, Doggy.

- Okay. There you go.

- But it's a dog.

- Yeah, I know. That's why it's funny.

- I don't think it's as funny as you think it is.

- Can we please just call your sister?

- No, no. Cam- Cam- - Why?

- So she can be all judgmental and condescending,

- like she's the expert and

- I don't know how to take care of a baby?

- Mitchell, she is your family.

- Of course she's gonna be judgmental and condescending.

- Hello?

- Hey, hi, um- Not a big deal. Just wondering.

- When your kids were small, did you ever

- I don't know- smack their heads into a wall?

- Usually we just gave time-outs.

- No, no, accidentally.

- Um, we just kind of bonked Lily's head.

- It wasn't very hard and she's not acting any differently,

- but I just worry

- Relax. It happens.

- Luke used to bang his head all the time and he's fine.

- Okay, all right, thank you. Thanks. That helps. Okay, okay.

- We gotta take her to the doctor. Load up the car.

-  Gloria? - I'm here.

- I, uh, just dropped Manny off at school, and I realized...

- I just dropped Manny off at school.

- Oh, boy.

- And I was hoping we'd still have a few more good years

-  before the mind started to go. - No, what I'm saying,

- we have the day to ourselves, the first time in months.

- We should take advantage of it.

- Go to the club,

- nice lunch,

- some massages.

-  What about work? - I'm the boss.

- Since I married you, people are surprised I come in at all.

- Jay's very spontaneous.

- He's always surprising me with little presents, fun getaways.

- I wasn't the greatest husband the first time around,

- but I'm trying to do better this time.

- And maybe by my third marriage, I'll have it down pat.

- Yeah, that one's gonna cost me.

- What ya reading there? A book?

- Yeah. I've been meaning to get to it for a while.

- Ooh, it's got a map at the beginning.

- I like it when books do that.

- Don't you have an open house this morning?

- I rescheduled.

- Thought you might like some company.

- Well, the first day of school can be tough

- for stay-at-home moms.

- Now, you have to understand,

- the kids are gone, the nest is empty.

- They are rudderless.

- And a lot of guys wouldn't even notice,

- but I'm not a lot of guys.

- I listen with my mind,

- and if you pay attention, women will tell you what they want...

- by telling you the opposite of what they want.

- Like the other day, Claire was, like, "You have to move your car.

- There's no space in the garage for both of our cars."

- And what she's really saying is that,

- you know, I should probably get a sports car.

- I was sort of looking forward to a quiet day.

- Thought I'd just read, maybe go for a run later, that's it.

- Great. We'll run together.

- You don't have to do that.

- I know.

- Listening.

- The thing is, I like to run alone.

- And I run kinda fast, so

-  So? - So I'm not sure you're gonna be able to keep up with me.

-  You're kid- you're kidding, right? - No.

- You really think I can't keep up with you?

- I'm not sure you can keep up with this conversation.

- I think you're forgetting that I power-walk every morning...

- and that I wear my special shoes with the big soles,

- which were designed by a doctor.

- Yes, I know. But I run every day.

- You really think you can run as fast as me?

- No, Phil, I think I can run much, much faster...

- than you.

- Boom. Just like that, the whole day changed.

- It was game on. She knew it.

- I knew it. We both knew it.

- I just wanna read.

- I think I'II order what I had the last time.

- What was that called?

- You want me to say it

-  because you want me to roll my R's. - Come on!

- Reuben.

-  Jay, what is this? - Oh, looks like my old car cover.

- Don't give me that. This is Manny's poncho.

- What is it doing here?

- Maybe he decided to take it off on the way to school.

- What did you say to him?

- Nothing. I... told some jokes.

- You say plenty with your jokes.

- Jay, he looks up to you.

- He respects your opinion.

- We dodged a bullet on this.

- Trust me. I've been down this road before.

- I remember one time Mitchell

- decided to wear a jaunty scarf to school.

- I kept my mouth shut.

- He got his jaunty butt kicked.

- My dad has this perception that I was very flamboyant as a kid,

- which is just- it's nonsense,

- because I kept the whole gay thing very under wraps.

- You know, I was just a guy's guy.

- I was basically a jock.

- You know?

- So we should crush Manny's spirit...

- and destroy everything that makes him who he is.

- I'm just saying,

- it's no fun to see your kid get picked on every day,

- getting tormented just because he's different.

- Now I'm telling you, it rips your heart out.

- Well, Batman doesn't get picked on and he wears a cape.

- A poncho is just a cape that goes all the way around.

- Batman doesn't get picked on because he's a muscular genius.

- Manny can't make it to the top bunk.

- We're taking this poncho to Manny at school.

- It's important that he knows we support him.

- And then we go get those massages, because that sounds good.

- I always take the stairs two at a time.

- I don't even think about it anymore.

- The regular way would seem weird.

- Phil, let it go. I'm faster than you.

- If only there was some way we could settle this once and for all.

- But how?

- You seriously wanna race me?

- I ran a half-marathon last year.

- Wow. I'm half-scared.

- Okay, we do need to do this. I'll go change.

- Not now. I got a conference call. But how about after that?

-  Great. This afternoon. - Sweet.

- Two at a time, two at a ti

- Son of a- Gotta fix that step!

- Two at a time! Already at the top, so

- Hi, I'm Dr. Miura. I'm on call today.

- Looks like we have a little head bump.

- Yeah, it happened a couple hours ago on a- on a doorjamb.

- We used to do this thing in school...

- where they would give you an egg and you couldn't break it.

- And it was supposed to teach you how hard it was to be a parent.

- But the real thing,

- I-it's so much harder. You know?

- We did that in my school too.

- Didn't turn out so well.

- I went through a dozen eggs.

- Yeah, well, he's a nervous eater.

- No, I broke a dozen eggs.

- I'm sorry. I just assumed that

- I know.

- I know what you assumed.

- There doesn't seem to be any mark.

-  Well, her head was somewhat protected. - Protected?

-  Was she wearing a-a hat? - Yes, yes, like a hat.

- It was a wig, actually. Sort of a ghetto-fabulous Afro thing.

- I thought it might be medically relevant.

- Really?

- You thought "Ghetto-fabulous" Might be medically relevant?

-  Maybe I should just finish with the exam. - Yes, thanks.

- You'll be pleased to know that Mitchell and I intend on

- raising Lily with influences from her Asian heritage.

- That is fantastic.

- Have you noticed any vomiting since the head bump?

- Uh, no. No, no, no.

- We've hung some art in her room. Some Asian art.

- And then when she's ready for solid food,

- there's a fantastic pho place...

- right around the corner from our house.

- Am I pronouncing that right? Is it pho?

- It's a soup.

- I don't know. I'm from Denver.

- We don't have a lot of pho there.

- Uh, just to be sure,

- could you show me how hard Lily got hit?

- And use your head.

- Um, yeah. Really, it was- it was just sorta, like, uh

-  You know? - Could I see that again?

- Um, it was just- just a head bump, you know.

-  How are you feeling? - Uh, fine.

- So is Lily.

- Babies are designed to survive new parents,

- so stop worrying.

- You guys are doing great.

- Thank you.

- Denver.

- I don't see any ponchos,

- which means either the kids don't wear them

- or the ones who do wear them disappear.

- We're doing the right thing.

- I support Manny no matter what.

- Children need to know that you believe in them.

- It's the most important thing.

- If you tell them they have wings,

- they will believe they can fly.

- Oh, really?

- I had a buddy, went to Woodstock,

- believed he could fly. Didn't end great.

- It's why hotel windows don't open anymore.

- Is something wrong? Who's died?

- No one, Manny.

- Why would you even think that?

- In Colombia,

- Manny went to Pablo Escobar Elementary School.

- If you were pulled out of class,

- it was definitely to identify a body.

- Well, we got your poncho here.

- I thought you said it made me look like

- my neck was wearing a dress.

- That was a joke.

- Oh, good! It's still in the pocket!

-  What do you got there, buddy? - My pan flute.

- I'm going to play some colombian folk music for my new classmates.

- Huh. Great.

- I have never been more proud of you.

- I'm sure your friends are gonna love it.

-  Break the flute. - What?

- The poncho by itself is fine.

- The poncho, plus the flute,

- plus the stupid dance

- my son will die a virgin.

- That's right.

- Hey, sport, can I take a look at that whistle?

- Oh, geez. Look at that.

-  And now you stepped on it! - What?

- What's wrong with me?

-  Here, let me get it. - Thank you.

-  You know, actually, maybe you should do this. - Why?

- I don't want to bump her head against the door,

- you know, pinch her with the seat belt.

- Mitchell, how long are you gonna beat

- yourself up over one mistake?

- Is this going to be like the blond highlights all over again?

- I just- I think I suck at being a father.

- What are you talking about? We're new at this.

- Yeah, but you're such a natural. I mean, look at you.

- You walk into the room and she lights up.

- Y-You change her diaper with one hand. I

- Nice. I-I'm actually jealous of you.

- There are so many things that you do that I can't.

- Y-You baby-proofed the entire house.

- You took care of all the adoption paperwork.

- Without you, we wouldn't even have a baby to injure.

- Just a couple of forms.

- Actually, that was a lot of paperwork.

- And you got her on all those preschool waiting lists.

- Can't believe you were gonna wait until she was "old enough."

- You see, that's what makes us a great team.

- We each have our own strengths.

-  Now, who are amazing parents? - We are.

-  I can't hear you. - We are!

-  Don't you forget it. - Okay.

- Did we just lock our baby in the car?

- Did you put the keys in the bag?

- I put the keys in the bag.

- Oh, Mitchell,

- I told you not to put the keys in the bag!

- Come on! Don't freak out!

- Lily, it's okay!

- *A-B-C-D-E-F-*
 *A-B-C-D-E-F-* 

- What, are you singing to her?

- People get arrested for this, Mitchell.

- *H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P*
 *H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P* 

-  Do all four doors lock? - Do you have a phone?

- What?

- I didn't say anything.

- Couldn't hear ya. I'm cranking one of my mash-ups.

- There they are.

- How was the first day back in prison?

-  Fine. - Yep

- What are you guys doing?

- Your mom and I are racing

- to the mailbox on Sequoia and back.

-  Why? - I don't know.

- Oh, she knows.

- Hey, buddy. Soon as I'm done kicking a little Mom butt here,

- how about I school you in some Mario Kart?

- Can't. Gotta work on my journal.

- Lame!

- Hey, uh, Alex. You?

- Uh, I have a history paper.

- Well, if you wanna see a little history being made right here

-  Not really. - Okay.

-  Ready? - Are you?

- I was born ready.

-  I came outta the womb wearing tiny little golden wings- - go!

- I'm breaking the window!

- Emergency assistance. This is Trina.

- Help! We I- We locked our baby in the car

- and people are judging us!

- I swear to God, I'm gonna break it!

- Do not break the window! You'll get glass on her!

- Sir, please tell your wife to relax.

-  Everything is going to be okay. - That's a man.

- Really?

- Don't worry, Lily! Daddy's coming for you!

- Sir, we just sent the signal.

-  The door should be unlocked now. - Check- Check the door.

-  Check the door. Check the door. - It's not unlocked!

- Okay.

- That is amazing. How did they do that?

- I don't know. It's just- We got it.

-  Thank you. - Did that come from space?

- I run five miles a day.

- I have a resting heart rate of 48.

- There is no way I'm going to lose

- a two-mile race to Johnny Ski Pole.

- Saving my energy, drafting off of you.

- You feeling cocky?

- Yeah, I am.

- Love it.

- But after seeing that T-shirt, I realized something.

- The first day of school is tough on all my kids,

- especially the one I married.

- Afterburners engaged!

- Whoo! Don't choke on my smoke!

- And down the stretch he goes.

- I don't believe it!

- Daddy wins! Do you believe in miracles?

- U.S.A., u.S. 

-  Oh, no! - Oh, Jesus!

- Oh, my- What was that?

-  Was that a person? - I'm good!

-  Dad? - I'm good.

-  Honey, are you okay? - I'm good. Whoo!

- You're getting better, sweetheart.

- Did I lose the race to make him feel better?

- Maybe.

- But it just seemed like he could use a win today.

- We do strange things for the people we love.

- We lie to them, we lie for them.

- There may be some bumps along the way,

- but we never stop wanting the best for them.

- That's what makes it such a tough job.

- Kind of the best job in the world.

-  What are you doing? - Turn your eyes on the road!

-  Oh, my God! - Oh, my God!

-  Okay. - Okay.

- All right, sweetie, this happens.

- Remain calm. That's the first thing.

- Pull over right here. I'll get out the registration.

- Mom, I don't like cops.

- Ok, pull over right there.

- I don't like cops.

- All right, there's a space right here...

-  I can't pull over. No, I can't. - You need to pull over!

-  No can do. No can do! - Phil!

-  I got priors. - I'm speeding up.

- Phil, you

- Parking ticket from the mall.

- I never paid the parking ticket.

- Keep moving, sweetheart.

- Dad's with me, I can speed up and

- It's not a movie, Hayley, and pull over!

S01E07 
----------------------
- Bravo! Bravo!

- Bravo!

- Bravo!

- Bravo, Manny! Bravo!

- Well, when I heard Manny wanted to fence, I was, like,

- "Sure. Uncoordinated kid, lethal weapon.

- How can this go wrong?"

- What do you think now?

- I'm proud of our little Zorro.

- I mean I worked with him a little, but the kid's got skills.

- It's in his blood. His father was a master swordsman.

- He was an artist with his sword.

- I mean, the way he throws the sword.

- I mean, he was legendary.

- You know this nice moment I'm having with your son?

-  You're kind of wrecking it. - Sorry.

- Did you know that fencing goes back to the 12th century?

- You know what's even nerdier than fencing?

- Knowing when it began.

- I don't think you're a nerd, Alex.

- Shut up, dork.

- All right. That's my boy!

- Would this be easier...

- if we suspended you from a crane?

- Any monkey can shoot a home movie.

- I pride myself on shooting home films.

- But, Cameron, you always just take things a little too far.

- No, I don't.

-  Okay, your nephew's first birthday. - That's not fair.

- You brought a wind machine.

-  To be fair, - Cameron,

-  my vision was-  - you brought a wind machine.

- Who puts wheels on cribs?

- Ay! Sorry. Sorry.

- That's okay.

- No. No, no, no, no! My phone died.

- No biggie. Your battery probably just statically defracticated.

- What?

- It means you can recharge it with static electricity.

- Just rub it on your hair.

- Yes!

- You know, I used to go to the houses of my friends,

- I'd see their kids' trophies,

- and it used to bug me, you know,

- because there was never a trophy in my house.

- Not until this one.

- Oh, that's a good grip.

- Can we switch seats?

- Cam, people are staring.

- I know you're not supposed to care,

- but it's kind of cool to have a kid in your house

- who's the best at something.

- You know what I mean?

-  Yeah, our kids are great. - They're the greatest.

-  Gosh, we're blessed. - We are. But, um,

- are they the best at something?

- I'd have to think about that.

- Well, Alex is great at every single thing she tries,

-  so, you know, she'll find her specialty. - She will.

- And Haley is

- Haley is so pretty.

-  Gorgeous, gorgeous girl. - Oh, gosh.

- So she can meet someone who's the best at something.

- That's right.

- And then, uh, I guess that leaves Luke.

- We dropped the ball a little bit on that one.

- Yeah, a little bit.

- Bravo!

- How about a nice round of applause for our winner, Manny Delgado.

- Manny now moves on to the championship,

- where he'll be competing against Caroline Markum.

- We'll see you all back here at 4:30.

-  All right. - Bravo.

- What she said.

- Wow. This means more to Dad than it does to Manny.

- Yeah, it's his chance to be father of a champion. 

- Well, second chance.

- We all know how the first time went.

- Did I say something wrong?

- No, no. I'm- I'm very happy for Manny.That's all.

- Everything's always about Claire. Geez.

- I wanna thank you guys for coming by and supporting the kid.

- You guys are the best!

- Why, Claire?

- Really?

- That took a while.

- She's been asleep for 20 minutes.

- It just took me some time to sneak out without waking her up.

- Kind of like the first time you slept over here.

- I had a meeting.

- All right. Let's talk about why you got your panties in a bunch.

- What's up with you and your sister?

-  Nothing is up. - Mm-hmm.

- Or could this have something to do with... ice skating?

- When Mitchell and Claire were kids.

- This is interesting to no one.

- Excuse, please. Let me finish. Thank you.

-  When Mitchell was 10 - Eleven.

- And Claire was 13, they

-  were competitive ice dancers. - Figure skaters!

- Oh, for God's sakes, I'll tell the story. Yes,

- my sister and I were actually a very good team.

- We were called "Fire and Nice."

- I was Fire, because of the red hair, and Claire was Nice,

- because it was ironic and she wasn't.

- And Mitchell is still upset

- because Claire quit the team right before some meet.

- "Some meet." The 13-and-under regional championships.

- Just the Emerald City at the end of my yellow brick road.

-  Wow. You did it. - What?

- You made figure skating sound even gayer.

- So, seeing your dad so proud of Manny...

- didn't stir up any resentment?

-  Mm-mmm. - Oh.

- Okay, fine. You always do this.

- Instead of letting your feelings out, you bury them,

- and then they bubble up later in hurtful ways.

- Okay, you know what? Yes. All right, listen.

- I might still be holding a little resentment,

- but that's... embarrassing and petty

- and it's not a good color on me.

- It's kind of like you and yellow.

- You love me in my yellow shirt.

- It makes you look like the sun.

- Bubbling. Hurtful bubbling.

- Now you know why I left early that morning.

- I knew you didn't have a meeting, Cam. I knew it.

- There must be something wrong with this phone.

- I've rubbed it on my head for, like, an hour.

- What? Alex.

- Oh, you're such a geek.

- At least I didn't give myself a bald spot.

- Oh, my God! Mom!

- Alex, don't be mean.

- Haley, stop making yourself such an easy target.

- This feels right, buddy. I'm telling you, this feels right.

-  What are you guys doing? - Pursuing excellence.

- We make a list of areas the boy might excel at

-  and... baseball. - Love it.

- Yeah. I read it only takes 10,000 hours to achieve excellence.

- You've already got, what, how many hours playing ball?

- Well, I played, like, one season, so, like, 6,000 hours?

- Yeah. I can see why you ruled out math.

- Yeah, of course I want Luke to be successful.

- But I don't think that a parent can just force that.

- I think you just have to have

- faith that the kid's gonna find his own way.

- Besides, Luke already is the best at something- being my son.

- It sounded a lot less lame in my head.

- I have got a good feeling about this.

- This is gonna be your sport.

- Last year, you said basketball was my sport.

- Look, I've said a lot of things I wish I could take back but I can't.

- What I can do...

- is be the dad you need me to be to help you become masterful.

-  You wanna be masterful? - I guess.

- There's my killer! Okay.

- Our journey of 10,000 hours...

- begins with a single pitch.

- I believe in my boy.

- I ain't gonna quit you.

- Let's burn one in here.

- That's good. That's a good start.

- Okay, you rest that cannon while I run this down, okay?

- Okay, let's keep all the batters right here.

- Oh, should've- should've worn my cup. Should've worn my cup.

- Home run!

- This one's really in here, buddy.

- Okay. Very, very, very, very good first hour.

- Toss me your glove. I'll put some oil on it.

-  Everything okay? - Yes.

- I was telling my grandmother how great was Manny today.

- So that wasn't angry talk?

- No, silly. That was happy talk.

- I'm beginning to understand

- why there's so much conflict on your continent.

- Here. Check this out.

- Ah, Jay.

- Jay loves to make T-shirts for special occasions.

- Come on, baby. Show them.

- A few years back, my granddaughter Haley ran a 5K,

- so I had a few of these made up.

- It's just fun.

- I love it when you're so proud of Manny.

- You know, I'm not gonna lie.

- Seeing him out there slicing those kids to pieces,

- you know, it gets to ya.

-  Gracias, mi amor. - I'm sorry to interrupt.

-  It's okay, papi. - Hey, champ! I got a little something for you.

- And I have something for you. Here.

- I will not be needing it anymore.

-  But the finals? - I am retired.

- Wait, wait, wait.

- You can't retire.

- It's just not fun anymore.

- Well, that's probably just butterflies.

- Come on. You're gonna be fine.

- Look, if he doesn't want to, it's his decision.

- Ah, the hell it is.

- He shouldn't be doing anything that makes him nervous.

- Papi, I support you.

- I'm not nervous. I just don't want to fight a girl.

- What?

- Defeating a woman will be a mark on my honor.

- Why?

- Because men are always so superior to woman?

- So superior that you cannot even finish your sentence?

- Dude.

- Manny, you always call yourself the lover of women,

- but if you don't compete with this girl,

- you're showing me and all the woman that you don't respect us.

- I'm sorry.

- Okay, so, take back your sword...

-  and go fight this girl like a bull. - Okay.

-  Can't hear you! - Okay!

-  I can't hear you! - That's really as loud as I can go.

- What does it take to make a great salesman?

- It's no big secret.

- You just follow the ABC's of salesmanship: Always Be Closing.

- Don't ever forget

- great home ideas just keep lurking, mostly nearby.

- Often people question realtors' sincerity.

- Take umbrage. Violators will

- Oh, shoot. X- X

- And this is the great room,

- although "Great" hardly seems to do a room like this justice.

- Weird, squiggly painting not included.

-  I actually love it. - I do too.

- It's really beautiful.

- Um, all custom built-ins, and you will notice just

- just tons of natural light, so that's great.

- Did I need the sale? Yes.

- Was I worried? No.

- Why? Because. Because why?

- Because I won't sell anything I don't believe in.

- And when I believe, you believe.

- I could sell a fur coat to an Eskimo.

- Yeah, Phil, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful house.

- But I'm just not sure how kid-friendly it is,

- and we have two small children.

- I mean, these stairs alone.

- Dad, this place is awesome.

-  Not now, Luke. - Did you see the backyard?

- It's got room for 10 tree houses.

- And the bedroom's got a window on the ceiling.

- I wish we could live here.

-  I wish you'd go back out to the patio where- - Do you really?

- Oh, yeah. Our house sucks compared to this one.

- It really does.

- There you are.

- I'm gonna get changed and

- then we'll go back to Manny's match, okay?

-  Dad doesn't want me to go. - What? Why?

- Remember when you were all worried that our son's a dud?

- Okay. That's not exactly the way I remember it.

- Turns out he's a natural.

-  At what? - At selling.

- Hey, Titans of residential real estate.

- That's right, I'm talking to you,

- Sandy Brewster, Skip Woosnum, J.J. McCubbin.

- Hear those footsteps? That's Luke Dunphy,

- and he's gonna drink your milk shake.

- That's amazing.

-  Right? - Incredible.

- So, the buyer's coming back

- in an hour with her husband, and I need him.

- I am telling you, that kid is a genius.

- There's the rainmaker.

-  Why is your iPod in your mouth? - I'm charging it.

- Alex. Alex!

- So, there's no part of you

- that wants to clear the air with your sister?

- Nope.

- Okay, fine. That's your family's way. I'll respect that.

- But you should know, it's hard on the people who love you.

-  Cam - We feel the tension.

- We hear the words that cut like knives.

- Hey, guys! I brought orange slices.

- Okay, you know what? I can't bear this.

- Claire, Mitchell still resents you

- for quitting the figure skating team when you were kids.

- Ladies, come inside with me, please.

- Work it out. Come on.

-  Thanks, Cam. - Is he serious?

- Is that what your little jab was about this morning?

- Okay. No. Yes. Okay, yes. Yes.

- I guess I'm still a little angry.

- But, you know, you stole my moment, Claire.

-  Yeah, 21 years ago. - Okay, but it doesn't matter to you...

- because you had your own moments.

- You had cheerleading and high school plays

- and making out with the quarterback.

- Oh come on, You made out with him too.

- Yeah, but we had to keep it a secret.

- You shouldn't have quit.

-  It was selfish. - You wanna know why I quit?

-  I quit to protect you. - From what?

- Glory? Fame? Press conferences?

- What? Come on. I was bigger than you.

- I was bigger than you,

- and I was afraid you wouldn't be able to lift me.

- You were dropping me in practice,

-  And I didn't want you to  - I dropped you twice.

-  Three times. - humiliate yourself in front of all those people.

- You dropped me all the time.

- Come on. Could you just forgive me and move on?

- Of course. Yes, yes. Yes, of- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

- Oh. This must seem so petty, huh?

- Well, it's a little silly, but we all have our thing, don't we?

- I'm just glad you're getting it out of you.

- Are you trying to lift me? You are. You're trying to lift me. Oh!

- Stay focused, stay loose and stay angry.

-  Who's the toughest? - I am.

-  Who's the bravest? - I am.

- Who's the baddest?

- Can you guys ask all the questions now

- so I don't have to keep lifting this?

-  Go. - Go get 'em!

-  There we go. You all set? - Yeah.

- Okay, go get 'em. Good luck.

-  Excuse me. Is this seat taken? - No. Sit.

- Oh, thank you.

-  Oh, is Manny yours? - Yes.

- Oh, he's quite good. I saw him earlier.

- Thank you.

-  Is she your little girl? - Oh, Caroline? No. No.

- Sadly, her parents passed away.

- I'm her nurse down at the children's hospital.

- But all of my patients are like family to me.

- Well, our boys are enjoying themselves.

- Yeah. I can talk about

- crown moldings and recessed lighting until the cows come home,

- but nothing compares with that sound right there.

- Oh. Hey, buddy. Oh, he's fine.

- My foot. I think it's backwards.

-  It's not backwards. - Wh-What happened?

- It's the stupid floors! They're too slippery.

- Oak. Also known as nature's pillow.

-  It's like ice. - Now, let's not start blaming the floors.

-  You shouldn't have been running. - I saw a ghost.

- Ghosts. Hey, Phil Dunphy. Okay, that's me.

- That's acting like a natural shoehorn.

- Okay. Probably better all take

- our shoes off for this part of the tour. Follow me.

- She's our little miracle.

- Oh. I only wish her father had made it back

- from Afghanistan to see this.

- Oh, there's our cheering section.

- Over here, you guys.

- Oh, my God. We have to stop him.

- Maybe I can pull the fire alarm.

- Expect no mercy.

- Bring it on, big boy.

- I'm-I'm glad Dad's proud of Manny. I am.

- I just- It would have been nice to see him that proud of us.

- By us, I mean me.

- And you sincerely thought that the path to Dad's approval...

- was going to be through figure skating?

- Mitchell, I am fairly confident that Dad's proudest moment...

- was when you finally took off the flame-red unitard.

- I am not claiming that any of this is rational.

- I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry for being such a pill, okay?

- Um, actually, I always felt very guilty for quitting.

- I know how much you loved figure skating.

- I never really loved skating.

- Uh, what?

- Um, all right, this is gonna sound a little gay.

- But, um, when-when you and I skated together,

- you weren't the mean older sister

- and I wasn't the clingy little brother.

- We were- we were a team, and

- Well, let's face it,

- we've kind of grown apart in the past few years.

- And with Mom and Dad's divorce, we were on opposing sides.

- And I- I just- I miss being on your team.

- That's...

-  a little gay. - There we go.

- Claire, where are you going?

- Claire?

- No way.

- Get up.

-  Really?  -Mm-m

- Don't drop me.

- Put it away or lose it.

- Somebody's got to put a stop to this.

- That's it, Mitchell.

- So, can we take you and Caroline out for ice cream?

- We can't. She's diabetic.

- Of course she is.

- A round of applause for our winner, Manny Delgado.

- Let's get out of here. Get this thing in the trunk.

- I can't decide if I'm feeling more proud or mortified.

- How about now?

- We tell our kids it doesn't matter if you win or lose,

- but let's be honest.

- Winning feels pretty great.

- There's nothing like that golden moment in the sun.

- I think every parent probably wants that for their child.

- And maybe a little bit for ourselves too.

- Sometimes we push too hard.

- And that leads to a lot of resentment and guilt.

- Yes! Yes!

- So, how much is too much? Here's where I come out.

- Guilt fades.

- Hardware is forever.

-  You're mad, aren't you? - I'm not mad.

-  Yes, you are. - No, I'm not.

-  You're a little jealous. - I'm happy for the two of you.

- All right, come on. We'll do one. Stay there.

-  For real?  -Yep.

-  Feel better? - Yeah. Oh, do me now. Come on.

- What are you talking about?

- Are you serious?

- Cam, no.

S01E08 
----------------------
- Ah- Fix that step.

-  Morning! - I'm still sleeping.

-  Happy anniversary. - Hmm.

-  And they said we wouldn't last. - Yeah.

-  Who said that? - Oh, look at you. You're cute.

-  Go ahead. Open it. - What have you done?

- Nothing. Something. Nothing.

-  It's a View- Master. - Look inside.

- Oh, it's us.

- Look at how young we are.

- Oh, God, that perm.

- Yeah, it really framed my face.

- Why is there a picture of a bracelet?

- Huh. Must be some kind of a mistake.

-  What the heck is that? - Phil, you didn't.

-  What did - Did he, did he? 

- Oh, my God.

- It's beautiful. Oh, sweetie, I love it.

-  Okay, your turn. - My turn? Where is it?

-  It's on the bureau. - Oh.

- I'm surprised I didn't see it.

-  Where? - It's there. The red envelope.

- Oh. So - - card? 

- No. That's where you're wrong.

- I am so excited.

- Hey. Coupons for...

- five free hugs.

-  You don't like it? - Are you kidding me? I love it.

- It's so creative. Coupons for hugs, 

- which are usually free.

- But this makes it official, which is so great.

- I was so proud of myself when I thought of it...

- because you're impossible to buy for.

- You never want anything.

- Um, things I want:

- Robot dog, night- vision goggles, bug vacuum,

- G.P.S. Watch, speakers that look like rocks.

- I love my wife, but she sucks at giving gifts.

- I'm sorry for the pay- channel language, 

- but- Oh, yogurt maker.

- I can't not think of things I want.

- I can't tell if she needs a diaper change.

- I'd think we'd be able to tell.

- No, with these diapers, it's hard to tell.

-  Triple leakage protection. - LeakLock.

- Contours to protect her little body.

- No gapping or chapping.

- Cam, do you think that maybe we need a- 

- Night out. Yeah.

- Yeah. Yes. Just a few hours with a couple of adults,

- few drinks, no baby talk.

- It'll make us better parents. 

- Stop drilling. You've struck oil.

- We'll get Gloria to babysit. We're going out.

- You got some spittle. 

- Do I? You know who'd be fun to call?

-  Sal. - Sal.

- Ooh, raise the roof, Lily. Yeah.

- We're calling Sal.

- Sal is our very best friend in the whole wide world.

- The reason we love her so much...

-  is she has absolutely no inhibitions. - No.

- And that's before she starts drinking. 

- Hanging out with her...

- is like an Amsterdam Saturday night every day of the week.

- And, ironically,

- Sal's not allowed back into Amsterdam. 

- Any day of the week.

- Of course we would love to have the baby.

- All the other cousins are sleeping over tonight.

- The more, the merrier. 

- Okay, see you tonight. Bye- bye.

- Is Haley still coming?

- You're related. I will spray you with the hose.

- All the grandkids are

- coming over for Jay's Night. Family tradition.

- Everybody wears P.J.'s, which they love.

- I make my famous sloppy Jays, which are really sloppy joes...

- but made by Jay, which they love.

- And then we all watch a Western together,

- which they don't really care for, but hey, it's Jay's Night.

- So, Mom, there's a party tonight at Andrew Adler's,

- and everybody's gonna be there.

- Ooh, that sounds like so much fun, but I have other plans.

- Oh, that's hi- larious. But I'm talking about me.

-  That's unusual. - Honey,

- you said you'd go to your grandfather's tonight.

- See, that's what's so perfect about this.

- Andrew only lives, like, a couple blocks away from Grandpa's.

- So I figured that I could go- 

- Sweetie, you made a commitment.

- But I really want to go. Plus, every time I go over to Grandpa's,

- Manny just stares at me the whole time.

-  Maybe if you wore a bra- - Alex.

- What? I can't wait to go to Grandpa's.

-  Family means everything to me. - 'Cause you have no friends.

- No. Because I love Grandpa.

- And he's getting older.

- Who knows how many years he has left?

-  Is Grandpa dying? - Didn't they tell you?

- Alex, stop torturing your brother.

- No. Your grandfather is fine.

- For now.

- Hmm. Who could that be?

- You expecting someone special?

- Thank you.

-  Flowers too? - I'm sorry.

- Oh, what are you apologizing for? They're gorgeous.

- That's too much. With the View- Master and the bracelet...

- and the flowers and the balloons- 

-  Balloons? - They're attached to your car.

- I just don't want you to feel bad...

- about your little... coupons.

- Wait a minute. You- You

- thought the coupons were your only present?

-  Are you kidding me? - They aren't?

- No! Oh, Phil, come on. 

- It's our anniversary.

- Those coupons were just, like,

- a fun little way to kick off the day.

- Your real present is coming tonight, and you're gonna love it.

- Love it.

- Cool.

- I got nothing.

- I'm so screwed.

- Oh, this place brings back so many memories.

-  Oh, my God! - Sal!

- Get up! Get up! Get in here! Big bear!

- Oh, my baby cub!

- Oh, my God. Look at you.

- Oh! You guys notice anything different?

- Your hair's longer, right?

-  No. - Did you get your teeth bleached?

- No. Let me give you a little hint. Ba- boobs!

-  Oh, my God. - Oh, wow. Those are sensational.

- I know, right? You wanna touch 'em?

- I'm gay, not dead. Are you okay with this?

- Yeah. You're drinking a passion- fruit daiquiri. 

- I'll be fine.

-  Okay, get in there. - I'm coming in.

- So, Lily likes that, that... singing?

-  Yes. It relaxes her. - Oh, okay.

- So Lily's deaf.

- There are my little stinkers.

-  Howdy. - Hi, Grandpa.

-  Come on in. - Hey.

-  Hola. - Hola, hola.

- Well, hello there, Haley.

- Take it down a notch, Jethro.

- So, you guys ready for some fun?

- What?

- I love you, grandpa, and I'm never gonna forget you.

- Okay, okay. Back at ya, champ.

- Whoa, whoa, whoa. This is a pajama party. Where's your P.J.'s?

- Yeah, they're in my bag. I need to talk to you about something.

- She wants to go to a party with Dylan, grandpa

- Shut up, Alex.

- It's at my friend Andrew Adler's.

- He lives three blocks from here.

-  Oh. Walking distance. - Right.

- So I wouldn't ask you this, 

- because I love coming to your house,

- but it's kind of an important party, and I- 

- Somebody invites you over,

- the last thing you wanna do is insult them.

-  Exactly. - I'm glad we agree.

- Oh, my God. That was so easy. This is awesome.

- You really don't understand what just happened there, do you?

-  P.J.'s on, Haley! - What?

- Um, I would be happy to let her change in my room.

- Who could that be? Are you expecting someone special?

- What did you do?

- Nothing. I just know that there's someone at the door.

- Rock on, Phil Dunphy. 

- Bam! Read it and weep, Phil.

-  Oh. - It's the Iz.

-  Who? - Izzy LaFontaine from Spandau Ballet.

- Dizzy Dontaine from Spa, Hey. 

- He's got it now.

-  He's got it. He's just seriously freaking out. - Yes!

- Phil loves Spandau Ballet.

- That song "True" was playing in the car the first time we kissed.

- It's our song. So I did some research,

- found out that the lead guitarist lives,

- like, 40 miles from here.

- He was in the phone book. 

- How '80s is that?

- I never liked Spandau Ballet.

- Our entire marriage, 

- I never once mentioned Spandau Ballet.

- Am I even pronouncing that right?

- Here to play a private concert for us is the guitarist- 

-  Bass player, actually. - And lead singer- 

-  Well, backup, backup. - Of Spandau Ballet.

- Between Richard Miller and Martin Kemp. 

- Oh, those guys.

-  I miss you two guys so much. - Oh.

-  So, so much. To us. - Yeah.

-  To us. - To us, the Three Musketeers.

-  Cabo! - What?

- Seriously, you bastards. We've been talking about it forever.

- We're doing it. We're going to Cabo. Let's do it. Let's do it.

- All right. Let's go. 

- Yeah. Yes. Yes. That would be fun.

- Fun? Are you joking?

- Margaritas, you guys, these guys.

- It's gonna be epic. 

- Yeah, but we need to find someone for Lily.

- Okay, okay. Um,

- how much are you gonna pay me to go make out with the waitress?

- All right. Now, wait. Which one? 

- The old one or the young one?

- Ten for the young one, 20 for the old.

- I am about to make 30 bucks.

-  I'm just gonna go check on Lily real quick. - Right now?

-  Yeah. It'll just take a second. - Well, I'm just- 

- you're gonna miss me sluttin' it up with Driving Miss Daisy.

-  It'll just take a second. - Real fast.

- You should kill that baby.

-  What? - You should call the baby.

- I love you guys so much.

-  Did she just- - I'm scared.

-  I got nothing. - I think I have a very good pair.

-  You sure do, honey. - And I got squat.

- I don't think I have anything either.

- Are you kidding me? That's a straight.

-  Really? - She wins.

- You won.

-  I win. - You got it, Haley.

- You know what? I think I deserve a soda.

-  Good job, Haley. - Did you see that?

-  "I don't know how to play." - She didn't even know.

- You know, she deserves it.

- Hi, honey.

-  Gee, you scared me. - How did you- 

- Lightbulb went out. You don't change these right away, 

- you never get around to it.

- There. 

- Now I can see everything that goes on around here.

- I've had a little practice at this.

- Haley wasn't throwing anything at me I hadn't seen before

- from her mother and then some.

- But nobody gets off The Rock.

- Right. Here's a track. Wasn't so popular in America.

- Got to number six on the Netherlands charts though.

- That whole summer I couldn't walk to the corner in Amsterdam

- without mobs of birds coming up 

- and asking me for the double bubble.

- Okay, just play it, I think. Yeah.

- He's- He's awesome, honey.

- You're welcome. 

- *Tonight*

- *So right*

- *So right*

- *Lover*

- Hey, Phil, I think your lover wants a kiss from you.

- Oh. Okay.

- Oh, come on, man. She's not your sister. 

- Give her a proper snog.

- You all right?

- That's a bad joke. Not funny.

- My sister lost her feet to complications from diabetes.

- Okay. Can I get you some water there, guy, or- 

-  Yeah. - You got tea?

-  Yes, of course. I'll get that. - Chamomile.

-  You don't miss a minute. - Okay.

- Oh, God. Why did- You know, look at what I'm doing.

-  I'm- I'm making it all about me. What a downer. - No.

-  It's your evening. Let's make it great, man. - No.

- Name your playlist. I'll do it all.

- Oh, um, just the classics.

-  Let's play the hits. - We'll get to the hits, obviously.

- Go to the back catalog, man. Favorite B- side.

- That's fun. Yeah, that's fun. Uh, just- I'm so bad with titles.

- Hum it. 

-  *Tonight*  - I just did that one, didn't I? Yeah.

- That's why it's in the noodle. So I guess- 

-  No. What album is that on? - Second. I wanna say second.

- What's on the cover? 

- There's a warlock, I think, or a seascape.

- Warlock. Oh. Millennium Sunrise.

- Millennium Sunrise. 

- There is no Millennium Sunrise record.

- What- What? You're not a Fandau.

- You didn't even know who I was at the door.

- I saw it in your eyes.

- Please don't say anything to Claire.

-  She made a mistake. - Am I being punk'd?

- This means so much to her, and I don't wanna hurt her feelings.

- Her feelings? Well, what about my feelings?

- This is my career, man.

- You know, my music was the soundtrack to people's lives.

- Now I'm nothing. How do you think that feels?

- This is really humiliating.

- No, no, no. Don't go. Don't go.

- Hey. What are you guys doing?

- He let me touch it!

- Yeah, I think she said "kill," Cam. I do.

- Maybe it was just a joke. She's always had a dark sense of humor.

- That's true. Remember her Halloween costume?

- When she came as Siegfried and part of Roy.

-  It was too soon. - Yeah. Yeah. This was just a joke.

- Yes. Yeah. Here she comes.

- Look, I'm gonna bring up Lily. We'll see what she says.

-  Show her some pictures. - Pay up, bitches.

- Whoa. More drinks.

- Free drinks.

-  Sal, you've got to look at these pictures. - What are they?

-  It's Lily at the zoo. - Oh, cute.

-  Look at that one. - Cute! Cute. Cutie, cutie, cute, et cetera.

- So you guys are gonna have to bring Lily to Cabo,

- now that you're the guys that always bring Lily?

-  Well, you know- - Yeah, probably.

-  I will throw her in the ocean. - What?

- I said I gotta go pee.

-  Okay, that wasn't even close. - Nope.

- I mean, what do we do? Do we say something?

- How do we even bring it up?

- She threatened our child, and that's your concern- a segue?

-  You know what this is? - What?

-  This is first- child syndrome. - What?

- It's where the first child is happy,

- and then the second child comes along,

- and the first child gets jealous of the second child 

- and starts acting out.

- Yes. That's brilliant, except Sal's not our child, so- 

- Think about it. Listen, we've practically done everything for her.

- We've held her when she's cried.

- We've carried her when she couldn't walk.

-  We've done everything but potty- train her. - Um- Hey, guys.

-  I was thinking- Oh. - Oh. Sorry.

- When we go to Cabo, 

- we have to find a hotel with a swim- up bar,

- 'cause this going back and forth to the bathroom is a fool's game.

-  Okay, let's get more drinks. - Sal, we got to talk.

-  It's about Lily. - Oh, shocker.

-  Okay. - Do you think it's at all possible...

- that maybe- maybe you're jealous of her?

-  What? What? - It's just- 

-  I don't know. - I don't- Where- Why would you say that?

- Well, because you won't look at any pictures of her...

- and you talked about killing her and throwing her in the ocean.

- Okay, that was a joke, you guys. Come on.

- Fine. Show me the pictures of Yoko.

- See, it's...

- It's a joke. You guys! Come on.

- 'Cause she's Asian, and she broke up our group.

- I- I just- Look, let's at least

- acknowledge that things have changed between us.

- And you know what?

- Because Lily's here doesn't mean we love you any less.

-  No. Absolutely not. - What's wrong?

- We used to be really close, and

- you used to call me a lot. And now you never call me.

-  Well, but we- - No.

- And last week I had a really bad dream,

- and I was thinking, "Okay, I'm gonna call them."

- And then I thought, "Oh, no, you can't call them...

- because you might wake up their baby."

-  You can always call. - Oh, honey, always call us.

- No. I'm sorry we haven't been there. 

- We're here now, okay?

- Okay?

-  Feel better? - I think you just put a little- 

- Spittle?

- Did she just fall asleep?

- I wish Lily would fall asleep like that.

- Give her eight shots of tequila.

- I don't understand why she's not falling asleep.

-  I have a theory. - I got the movie.

- Manny, why don't you go fire up some popcorn?

- You looking for these?

-  You took my shoes? - No, I took your freedom.

- Sorry, kid. It ain't your night. 

- Why are you being like this?

- I just wanted to go to that party for, like, two hours.

- I would've been back by now. Would that have killed you?

- She's just like her mother.

- Why are you treating Haley like this?

- Me? She's the one acting like a pill.

- You're taking this too personally.

- When I was Haley's age, I loved my grandfather,

- but I still wanted to go to parties and be with boys.

- I know. I know. So did Claire... and Mitchell.

- But you know what? 

- You try to put something over on me, you're gonna lose.

- So, what? Now you're gonna make this into a big game?

- I'm trying to keep 'em around a little bit longer, that's all.

- I mean, who knows how many nights like this I got left?

-  I miss you already. - What's wrong with this kid tonight?

- Go in the kitchen and help out the guys, and I'll be right in.

- It's great that you wanna spend time with your granddaughter,

- but is this really the way?

-  Fine. - You're a good abuelo.

-  She's upstairs. - I know.

- Dylan!

-  Yeah? - Get up.

- You're here to take Haley to the party, right?

-  Yeah. - She's in the house.

- How did you know I was here?

- This is how I first met Phil.

- Thanks again, Grandpa. We'll be back by 11:00.

-  I will track you down. - I believe that.

-  What's that smell? - Sloppy jays. Help yourself.

- There's plenty left. 

- Oh. Sloppy jays because your name's Jay.

- Right on.

- Can't believe she's into this guy.

- If you want, I'll fix you a plate.

-  Yeah, definitely. That'd be great. - But what about the party?

- We can go in just a minute. Just let- 

- Oh, no way. The Gunfighter. I love this movie.

- Dylan, the party.

- Oh. But... cowboys.

- Don't fight it, Haley. They never grow up.

-  Thanks. - I'm going to the kitchen for an espresso.

-  Anybody need anything? - No, thanks.

- Okay.

- Two, three, four.

- The year was 1991.

- America was immersed in Desert Storm.

- Meanwhile, stateside, another storm was brewing...

- in my heart.

-  This is stupid, isn't it? This is- - No.

-  Is it stupid, Phil? - No. Just keep- keep going, Claire.

-  It's wonderful. - Okay.

- After a romantic dinner at Fratelli's,

- a certain nervous young couple shared their first kiss...

- as the radio played this song.

- *So true*

- *Funny how it seems *

- *Always in time* 

- *But never in line for dreams*

- *Head over heels when toe to toe*

- *This is the sound of-* 

- You know what? No. No. Sorry. Sorry. Not gonna do it.

- What's wrong?

-  What's going on? - Do you even know the name of this song?

-  P- "True."

-  "True." - "True."

- Right. This is false. See?

- I'm not gonna play "True" for someone who's false.

- See, he doesn't- He doesn't even know the band.

-  He's not a fan, a Fandau. - Yes, he does know the band. 

- Of course he does. 'Cause this is our song. 

- You love this song. Tell him this is our song.

-  Right. Tell him, Phil. - It's not our song, Claire.

- Our song is 

- "If You Leave" by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark.

- OH!  - Are you sure?

- Pretty sure. I sang it at our wedding.

- Oh, I'm an idiot.

- Well, actually, he's the idiot.

- He fell in love to a break- up song.

- Ignore him. This is beautiful.

-  I love it. - I hate this. I hate this.

- You're so sweet and nice, and I can't even give you...

- a decent anniversary present.

- I love you so much, and I feel you just are never gonna know it.

-  I know it. I know it.  - You do know it?

-  Yes.  - You do? 

- And this is an awesome gift.

-  You know why? - Why?

-  You just gave us a new song. - Okay.

- Sort of brought you back together, eh?

-  Seems. - Sort of. 

-  Rekindled fires of a dying passion? - Sure.

- Shot a ray of hope into this gloomy suburban lie?

-  All right, buddy. - Just play it, lzzy.

- For you, Claire.

- *I know this*

- *Much is true*

- *I know this*

- *Much is true*

-  She is so sweet. - Isn't she?

- Like a little angel.

- Let me hold her.

- Oh, thank God.

S01E09 
----------------------
- Do we know anything?

- No. They're in there now with the doctor.

- We're lucky though.

- The paramedics said it could have been a lot worse.

- My God, how did this even happen?

- There he is. Big day's coming up.

- What do you want for your birthday, big dog?

- It's okay. I'm good.

- Come on. Sky's the limit.

- Dream big, my boy.

-  Well, I guess I could use a belt. - A belt?

- Yeah, you're right. I don't need it.

- Extension cord works pretty good.

- Every year, Luke's birthday falls right around Thanksgiving,

- and so it gets lost in the holiday shuffle.

- One year we forgot completely,

- and we had to improvise a cake of stuffing.

- Which, by the way, he was fine with.

- He's one of those kids,

- you get him a gift and all he wants to do is play with the box.

- Yeah, one year we actually just got him a box,

- a really nice box.

- And we made the mistake of putting it in a gift bag.

- So he played with the gift bag.

-  We can't get it right. - No.

-  I feel terrible. We gotta do something. - Oh, yeah.

- You know, the family is gonna be together for Thanksgiving...

- for the first time in I don't even know how long.

- I am so with you. We should blow this out...

- and throw Luke the best birthday party of all time.

- Yes. Yes. And we'll order a whole bunch of pizzas...

- and set up an arts and crafts table.

-  A what? - A crafts table.

- You know, where everybody gathers around

- and they make stuff, and then bam!

- They got their own party favor.

- Sorry. I fell asleep

- while you were describing the most boring party ever.

-  See you in a few hours. - Yeah.

- Thanks again for the karaoke machine.

- I'll get it back to you right after the party.

- That'd be great.

- Please don't. I beg you.

-  Don't bring it back. - Okay.

- Hey, Phil. Are, uh, you getting a clown for today?

- Oh, no. Luke's not much of a clown fan.

-  Really? - Yeah. He never liked 'em.

- Has he ever seen a good one?

- Has- Has anyone?

- Really. So anyway, thanks again.

- Okay. See you later.

-  No clown? No- No clown? - Let it go.

- Who throws a party without a clown?

- Since the late '30s, I'd say most people.

- You know what? We haven't gotten Luke a present yet.

- Maybe a clown could be our present.

- Cameron. Cameron.

- If Phil and Claire wanted to get Luke a clown,

- they would've. This is not our party.

-  But- - this is not our party.

- But I just

- Fine.

- What would you suggest we get him then, hmm?

- Get him a gift card.

-  A gift card? - Yeah.

- Who hurt you?

- Hey, Gloria,

- you got any idea how to wrap one of these things?

-  Is that a crossbow? - Yeah.

- Am I the greatest grandpa in the world or what?

- We can't give Luke a crossbow.

- He pokes himself in the eye every time he uses a straw.

- Are you kidding? I had one when I was his age.

- My dad used to give me a quarter for every crow I bagged.

- And I used to have a machete.

-  But times have changed. - He'll be fine.

- I'll teach him how to use it.

- Hey, pal, how's it going?

- Am I charming?

-  Oh, boy. - Of course you're charming.

-  Who said you were not charming? - No one.

- But there's a girl in my school, and I want her to like me.

-  I need your advice, Jay. - Really?

- She's gonna be at Luke's party.

- Well, I'm a little thrown.

- I mean, you don't usually come to me for advice.

- Well, this is one area in which you've done pretty well.

- He has a point.

- I've tried everything to get her attention

- opening doors, having a milk sent over in the cafeteria.

-  Nothing's worked. - Here's the deal.

- Girls don't go for all that romantic stuff.

- They go for power and success.

- And since you don't have either one of those things,

- you're gonna be the funny guy.

- No, no, no. I want the most dangerous reptile you've got.

- I have an iguana that eats crickets.

- That'd be scary if it was a birthday party for crickets.

- Seriously, Jungle Tanya,

- I need you step it up a notch.

- Is there anything that scares the cocoa out of you?

- Uh, not really. I do have a bearded dragon.

-  Ooh. Does it- - No, it does not breathe fire.

- Well, then we're back to square one, aren't we?

- I couldn't get Luke out of my mind.

- I know I made a promise to Mitchell,

- but some things are bigger than promises.

- Fizbo would be at that party.

- Hello, old friend.

- It all happened so fast.

- I keep thinking

- there was something I could've done.

- No, don't blame yourself.

- Who could've possibly seen it coming?

- Sweetie, that's a rock wall. Is that even safe?

-  Oh, my God. - Honey, relax.

- Hey, has anyone ever gotten hurt on one of these things?

-  I don't know, man. It's my first day. - See?

- They wouldn't let the new guy do it if it

-  That did not make me feel better. - Don't worry.

- I signed, like, a hundred releases.

- When did we decide all this? I think it's too much.

- See, I knew you'd say that.

- That's why I didn't tell you.

- So just relax. Grab a snow cone.

-  There's a snow cone machine? - Yeah.

- Mom, just so you know, Dylan cannot have mayonnaise.

- That's random. Why are you telling me that?

-  'Cause he's coming to the party. - Is that absolutely necessary?

- Yes, because she can't go 10

- minutes without her boyfriend's tongue in her mouth.

- It's like he's feeding a baby bird.

- Don't be so jealous.

- I'm sure you'll meet someone super hot at computer camp.

-  Girls. - Hey. Hey.

- So, what you got there?

- These are supplies for the crafts table.

- I finally figured out what we're gonna be making.

-  Kids bored? - I'm teasing. I'm teasing.

- It looks good. What is it?

- Comb sheaths.

- I know. I know.

- But we made them when I was 11 years old

- at Donna Rigby's birthday party.

- At first we thought it was really stupid,

- and then we had a blast, so

- How could you not?

- You combined the two things that kids love the most

- combs and sheaths.

- I'm kidding!

- Where's my comb? Oh!

- Here it is in my incredibly convenient beaded comb sheath...

- that I made at Luke's awesome birthday party.

- Hole in one, Mrs. Dunphy.

- Hole in one.

- I'm home.

- I got Luke a video game, but it's about math.

- So I guess we're those kind of uncles.

- Cam.

- Don't be mad.

- Oh. Cam. Uh

- I've known I wanted to be a clown...

- since I found out clowns were just people with makeup.

- Um, as a matter of fact, by the time I was a teenager,

- if I wasn't in school or fishin', I was clownin'.

- There are four types of clowns

- a tramp, an Auguste,

- a whiteface and a character.

- I am a classically trained Auguste clown

- named Fizbo.

-  What? N-Nothing.

- Between the clownin' and the fishin',

- I'm surprised you had time for the schoolin'.

- Aw, and there's the fifth type- the sad clown.

- Sad clown is a tramp. So there's still only four types.

- Cam, I thought we discussed this.

- We did. But I- I started thinking.

- And this isn't about you or me.

- This is about a little boy who deserves some happiness.

- And he's gonna get that from his weird gay clown uncle?

- Fizbo is not gay. He's asexual.

- He's an innocent whose only drive...

- is to bring people joy and laughter

- and balloon animals.

- He's- He's the least sexual being on earth.

- Oh, okay. Well, at least we agree on something.

- If this tape is found in the future,

-  this is how we humans celebrated birthdays. - Hey, Dad!

- Yeah, there's my boy. Zip-line extreme

- I'm okay. I'm good. I'm good.

- Lesson learned. Don't stand- Don't stand there.

- Let's go ahead and rope this area off.

- Excellent. Thank you.

- Hey, buddy, you having fun?

- Yeah. And I love my new belt.

- Hey, Luke. Look.

- Do you wanna make a comb sheath?

- A what?

- It's a cool leather holder for your comb.

- And you can decorate it.

- I've got beads and glitter and all kinds of stuff.

-  Do you want to? - Nah. I'm gonna do the rock wall.

- Okay, honey. It's your day.

- Honey, let me know if you get low on supplies.

- I'll make a quick run back to the 1950s for you.

- Oh! Again?

- Seriously, zip-line guys, use some ropes.

- Did you remember to switch the whites to the dryer?

-  Oh, no. I forgot. - They're gonna smell musty.

-  I know. I'm sorry. - I'll pump.

- No, no, no. I'll do it. You stay right here.

-  Relax. - Oh. I get it.

-  You're worried about people seeing me. - Without question.

- You know, people are gonna stare.

- They're not used to seeing one clown in a car.

- That's her- Bianca Douglas.

- She's so cute.

- She has good handwriting.

- She's a complete package. Wish me luck.

- You don't need luck.

- You just remember those jokes I told you, hmm?

- We have to stop meeting like this.

-  What? - We go to school together.

-  Oh, yeah. - Do you like jokes?

-  Sure. - Great. Ok.

- So a grasshopper named Gary walks into a bar.

- Aw. No.

- You're not supposed to know his name.

- Let me try another one, okay?

-  Knock, knock. - Who's there?

-  Interrupting cow. - Interrupting cow who?

- Moo. Oh, crap.

-  Um, hey. - Hey yourself.

-  Move. - You kind of just bumped me with your car.

- I don't think so.

- No. No, you did, because, um

- See, yeah, I got grease on my pants

-  and then also I felt it. - Call an ambulance.

- Okay. I just thought you might wanna know...

- in case you wanted to be a decent human being and apologize, but

- No? Okay.

- Ass.

- What did you say?

- Just forget about it, all right?

-  Listen, carrottop. I didn't touch you. - Um, I

- So do the smart thing. Shut your hole,

- get in your car and drive away.

- Is there a problem here?

- What the hell are you?

- I'm the ass-kicking clown...

- that'll twist you like a balloon animal.

- I will beat your head against this bumper

- until the air bags deploy.

- So apologize to my boyfriend right now!

-  Apologize? Boyfriend? - Apologize!

- Okay. I'm sorry.

- I'm sorry.

- Let's go. We're gonna be late.

- Mind if I come in?

- Sure.

- Come here.

-  Why you bounce so sad? - I told all my jokes.

- It turns out I'm not the funny guy.

- The right girl will find you when it's time,

- even though I'm gonna hate losing you to another woman.

- You'll never lose me, Mom.

- I'll always love you, no matter what.

- Ay, chiquitn.

- You see? Right there.

- You need no tricks.

- Just be the sweet, wonderful little boy that you are.

- Sweet little boy. Got it.

-  She won't know what hit her. - Vaya para all!

- Hey, Manny, wanna make a sweet comb sheath?

- Could not be a worse time, Claire.

- Oh. It's so peaceful and quiet over here.

- Ha-ha. If you came over here to gloat,

- I already know it's a dud.

- Actually, I came to give you this.

- It's your favorite flavor- blue.

- Thanks, honey.

-  And your hair looks really nice. Hmm. - Thanks.

- I've been combing it all day.

- All right, let's all give Luke a big hand for being so brave.

- This feels so weird. What does it eat?

- Oh, just little boy brains.

- Well, at least Luke's got nothing to worry about.

-  Is there mayo in this? - No. You're good.

- So I was thinking that maybe we could go slip away

- So, does anyone wanna pet the iguana?

-  Hells, yeah. Oh, man. - Over here! Me! Me!

- I love lizards.

-  What's his name? - Her name is Lizzy.

- Wow. I totally get that.

- You don't deserve this.

-  What? - Hot reptile chick.

- You know, probably has her own apartment,

- obviously okay touching gross stuff.

-  They're just talking. - You're right.

- Dylan's far too sophisticated to get sucked in...

- by a single lady with tons of cool tattoos.

- Hey. I think it peed on me.

-  Oh, no. - No way, Mother Nature.

- I can't believe he does that.

- Hey, what am I missing, guys?

- Aw, geez, Gloria.

- Jay, look! I go high! Look! Look!

- Guys, hit the road. Come on.

- You're family men. Come on. Scat.

- Great job, buddy.

- Now comes the fun part. Rappel down.

- It's really high.

- You have nothing to fear but fear itself...

- and the concrete.

- But I'm right here, buddy.

- Okay, just catch me.

- I am brave. Roller coasters? Love 'em.

- Scary movies? I've seen Ghostbusters, like, seven times.

- I regularly drive through neighborhoods...

- that have only recently been gentrified.

- So yeah, I'm pretty much not afraid of anything.

- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, everybody!

- Quit your clownin' around. That's my job.

- Except clowns.

- Never shared that with the fam, so... shh.

- Do have an image to maintain.

- I am not really sure where the fear comes from.

- My mother says it's because when I was a kid,

- I found a dead clown in the woods, but who knows?

- Hey. Oh. Well, you must be the birthday boy.

- Is that you, Uncle Cam?

- No. I'm Fizbo the clown.

- I don't know who this Uncle Cam is,

- but he sure sounds handsome, doesn't he?

-  Hey, who likes balloon animals? - I do! I do!

- It's just Cam. It's just Cam.

-  You all right? - What? Yeah.

- Just have kind of a complicated relationship with clowns.

- Well, join the club.

- Look, I came on strong with that whole funny guy bit.

- This is me just being myself.

- Okay. Hey, do you know who that boy is over there?

- Oh. That's Dylan. He's Haley's boyfriend.

- He's so cute and tall.

- I'm still growing. Give me a break.

- Pardon me, miss, but this little doggy needs a new home.

- Oh, thank you.

- That's quite an impressive getup you got there.

- Thank you, Jay. Oh, by the way,

- you have something on your shoulder.

- That's good.

- Never mind. It was nothing.

- We're done here.

- So, do you keep these at a zoo or something?

-  No. I just keep 'em at my place. - That's awesome.

- I only have a cat.

- Yeah? I used to have a cat.

- I was just messing with you before,

- but seriously, he's still talking to her.

-  Wow. Cool. - On it.

-  You know, this is one of- - I feel like Britney Spears.

- You're so funny.

- You kind of do look like Britney Spears.

-  Really? - I'm just kidding.

- Anyway, this is probably my favorite.

- Hey, jungle lady?

- I think- I think one of your bugs got out.

- What? This one?

- This box thing here- It's on its side.

-  Oh, my God. Where did it go? - Is everything okay?

- No. I lost a poisonous scorpion, and I need to find it.

- Okay, kids, let's all tuck our pants into our socks.

- Avoid shady, moist places,

- and let's make a game of looking where we step.

-  Is he okay? - Can we see him?

- He's in with the doctor right now.

- These things happen, right?

- No matter how careful you are.

- Hey, look what Grandpa gave me- a crossbow.

-  Sweetie, that does not look safe. - Don't worry.

- He's gonna show me how to use it.

- That's what... I'm afraid of.

- Come on. Ready?

- Oh, my God. You are not making comb sheaths.

- I am, and I know. It's really lame.

- Everybody hates it.

- No. It's just like, uh, Donna Rigby's party.

- Exactly! Yes! And I have the beads and everything.

- Amazing. This is awesome.

- So... Cam's a clown.

- Yeah.

-  I totally got you. - And there's mine.

- You think it's weird

-  that we both chose people who were so- uninhibited?

- I was gonna say "Embarrassing," But yeah.

- Look at them now. They're the life of the party.

- Uh, you know, I gotta say, for all his craziness,

- I love my clown.

- Me too. They're good for us.

- I would've totally tanked this party.

- And I would've gotten my butt kicked at a gas station.

-  Sorry? - Turns out Fizbo is a real bad-ass.

- Scorpion! Scorpion! Scorpion!

- Scorpion!

- No, no. Too close. Too close. Too close.

- What the hell?

- Oh, crap!

-  Calm down. - What happened?

- We fired the crossbow.

- No, I know. Oh, my God. It's right there.

- Bianca, I'm coming.

-  Who else is in there? - Get out!

- It turns out I'm not the sweet guy or the funny guy.

- No, Manny, don't go in! Por favor!

- I must!

- I'm coming!

- Manny Delgado is a man of action.

- Wait. My dog is still in there.

- I'll be right back.

- Ow! My arm!

- Sweetie? Luke?

-  What happened, buddy? - What happened?

- What happened, honey?

- Hey, hey. What happened?

-  I slipped on these stupid beads. - Oops.

- Come on. Here we go.

- How is he?

-  Oh, he's gonna be fine. - Ay, Dios mio.

- Hi, honey. How are you, kid?

-  Oh, there he is. - Pobrecito.

- You poor thing.

- Wow. Everybody's here.

- Of course we are. How's that busted flipper?

-  Okay. - Sorry about today, buddy.

- We'll try again next year, huh?

- Are you kidding? This was the best birthday ever.

-  What? - I got a cast.

-  You like a cast? - I've always wanted one.

-  After a few weeks, they start to smell. -Ew!

- You are so weird, you know that?

-  Can I sign it? - Sure.

-  Hey. Me first. - Here.

- If you'd asked me before the party...

- if I wanted there to be a chain reaction of disasters...

- that led to Luke breaking his arm, I probably would've said no.

-  Probably? - Prob- Definite- Definitely not.

- Would not want that.

- But, one way or another,

- Luke was the center of attention on his birthday,

- and the whole family was together...

- just the way it should be.

- Fizbo delivery! I brought the cake!

- Bravo!

- I can't do this.

- Oh, God. I'm out.

- Cake.

- Blow the candles. Blow the candles.

- Bianca Douglas called me three times tonight.

- I'm not gonna lie to you.

- I'm starting to feel smothered.

- I really like my cast, but it's starting to itch.

- Good thing my mom made me this personal scratcher.

- Oh, that's good stuff.

- If another woman is messing with your man,

- you have to get proactive.

- I don't care how pretty she is

- or how many stupid reptiles she has.

- She tries to take what's mine,

- girlfriend's gonna get stung.

S01E10 
----------------------
- Do we really have to wear these ugly sweaters?

- It's just until Grandma can see them.

- My neck hole is too small.  

- Mine's itchy.

- You know what? I'd rather be itchy than chokey.

- Come on, Phil. Hurry up.

- Okay, here we go.

- Connecting.

- Come in, Florida. Over. 

- Mom? Dad?

- Hello, Philip. 

- Merry Christmas Eve!

- Merry Christmas Eve!

- A little- little lower, Dad.

- Merry Christmas Eve!

- Thank you. 

-  Thanks for the sweaters. - I-I- Oh, you're welcome.

- You look beautiful in them, darling.

-  Where's Mom? - Mom is sinking fast.

- Uh-oh. She's in the bathtub.

- Get it?

- They have that claw-foot. 

- Honey, come on.

- Hey, pops, here's the tree.

- And, uh, there-there's the, uh- there's the ornament you sent us.

- Right here. Right here. Oh.

- There are the stockings, 

- hung by the chimney by Claire.

- Ah! Still funny, Son.

-  What the hell is that? - Still funny.

- What is that? That looks like a cigarette burn.

-  Was one of you smoking a cigarette? - What?

-  No. - Which one of you was smoking?

- Not me. I have a respiratory problem. 

- Obviously it wasn't you.

-  Now I've got a family of liars and smokers. -Honey, come here.

- You gotta see this.

- Did you shoplift your Christmas presents too?

-  Philip? - Haley, keep that ugly sweater on.

- Anyway, merry Christmas!

- No, no, it isn't that kind of a trial.

- It's just because he says he's Santa Claus.

- But I've got a feeling he is Santa Claus, Mother.

- Some people don't believe that. That's why- 

- Are you crying?

- What are you, a robot? It's a deeply emotional movie.

- Manny, miamor, I need you to help me in the kitchen.

- We gotta finish this first, Gloria.

- The kid's never seen Miracle on 34th Street.

- That's because he always

- spends Christmas in Colombia with my family.

- And all we see there is Salazar and El Oso Save Christmas.

-  Sounds like a classic. - It is.

- Mom, can we finish the movie?  

- Okay.

- He's not like anyone else.

- He must be Santa.

- I think perhaps you're right, Susie.

- What the hell is that?

- What the hell is that?

-  Inocente! - What the hell?

- When you told me we were going to watch this movie,

- I got a joke copy from the Internet.

- You are the inocente!

- Well, maybe I'm a little confused right now.

- What is this "Inocente" Stuff?

- In Colombia, practical jokes are a Christmas tradition.

- The one that is fooled is the inocente!

- We tell practical jokes on April Fool's Day,

- So do not do that again.

- "Inocente."

- Does it do it again? Ah, it's ruined.

- Are you kidding me with this line?

- I'm gonna ask Santa for the last 45 minutes of my life back.

- Would you cheer up? We're in Santa's Village with our daughter.

- Where were we a year ago? 

- We were at the beginning of this line.

- You know what? Somebody needs to get in the holiday- son of a bitch.

- Maybe it's not them.

- Oh, it's them. 

- It's them.

- Three years ago, I formed a caroling group.

- We were known as The Greensleevers.

- We would perform at charity events, hospitals

- They were very, very popular.

- Uh, last year, one of my carolers

- Andrew- staged a little coup. 

- And he, um

- They kicked Cameron out of the group.

- Thank you.

- We're the New Greensleevers.

- The New Greensleevers?

- Is there a slap mark on my face?

- I mean, why is Edna singing the low harmony?

- It's like people are applauding out of shock.

-  Let it go. - Why would

-  Okay, next. - Ah, finally.

- Whoa! I'm- I'm sorry. Can I- Could you

- What happened to the other Santa?

- Listen, we've been waiting in this line for a really long time,

- and we just want a Santa that actually looks like Santa.

- Mitchell, it's okay. 

- No, no, no. Cam, it's not okay.

- This is Lily's first Christmas.

- I want to make sure everything is perfect.

- We're gonna wait for the fat Santa. All right? 

- I knew this would happen.

- I-I don't even know why we hired this guy.

- See? Even his elves agree with me. Thank you.

- I didn't know Christmas made you so petty.

- Lackluster!

- I hate you!

- This is unacceptable, and I want to know who did this.

- Nobody, huh?

- I guess the couch did it to itself.

- Guess it came home after a tough day,

- lit up a cigarette and then it burned itself.

- Is that what happened? Because that makes no sense.

- If whoever is responsible doesn't come forward, 

- your father and I are just gonna have to punish all three of you.

- What? 

-  That's not fair! - I can forgive the smoking,

-  but I can't forgive the lie. - No.

- Or the smoking.

- No one wants to confess, huh? No?

- That's fine, 'cause you know what happens next?

- We cancel Christmas!

- That's not fair.

- Okay, Dad, sure.

- Phil has a habit of making big pronouncements to the kids.

- One time I told Luke...

- that if he didn't put his dirty dishes in the dishwasher,

- we would put them in his bed.

- Phil's problem is follow-through.

- We had no more dishes, 

- so we were eating cereal out of the goldfish bowl.

- Okay. Guess where I'm headed?

- To take down the tree. That's right.

-  Come on, guys. - This is your last chance.

- Whoever did this, just take responsibility.

- Don't put the rest of us through this. Luke? No?

- This is really it. Okay? Here we go.

- Three, two, one.

- Okay. Good-bye, Dunphy Christmas.

- Haley, I guess you're not getting that car.

-  I was getting a car? - Nope.

- I was lying, because that's what we do now.

- Dunphys are liars.

- When I was in charge, it was all about the music.

- I mean, what's with them tossing out candy canes after every carol?

-  It's pandering.  - I think you

- made that clear when you tossed them back.

- How am I supposed to get all this in the car?

-  Let me give you a hand with that. - Uh, thanks.

-  Thanks. Thanks, Santa. - Can't call me that anymore.

- Just got canned.

- Oh- really?

- Guess a couple people complained I wasn't fat enough.

- Well, that's terrible. 

- That's what I get for trying not to have a second heart attack.

- There you go. Always a way to make room.

- Take it from someone who lives in his car.

- Oh, well, thank you so much.

- No problem. Merry Christmas.

- Um, wait, wait. Um, please,

- uh, let me give you a little something...

-  for your troubles. - No, that's okay. 

-  Gosh. Really? Okay. -Do you really live in your car?

- Yeah. It's not so bad.

- It's pretty roomy since the wife moved out.

- Why don't you come over to our place for dinner tonight?

-  Seriously? - Yeah. It's Christmas Eve.

- Y-You can't spend it in your car.

- Wow, that's really nice of you guys.

- Listen, can I bring anything? 

- Ketchup, soy sauce, straws?

- We're good.

- So, uh, why don't you follow us to our house?

- Okay. In your house.

- All right!

-  Cameron. - What?

- Okay. Tonight, 9:00 sharp,

- we open one present each.

- Pajamas- which we sleep in.

- Tomorrow morning, 7:00 a.M., Manny,

- on the stairs for the Christmas picture.

- Then we open presents.

- In Colombia, 

- they open presents at midnight and stay up till morning.

- I'm sure that they do, 

- but as you'll notice from the absence of goats in the street,

- we are not in Colombia.

- Come on! I'm kidding.

- Why can't we mix a couple of Colombian traditions in?

-  Like what? - Like fireworks.

- Come on. You don't have fireworks in Colombia.

- You're trying to make me the inocente again.

- No, we do. At night the sky is beautiful- 

- very Christmassy.

- That doesn't make any sense.

- Look, every country has their own traditions.

- In our culture, for example, 

- the baby Jesus is the one... that brings the gifts, 

- not the Santa Claus.

- But that doesn't make sense.

- How could a newborn baby carry all those presents?

- They don't even know where their hands are.

- At least a baby can fit through a chimney.

- How would you sit on the baby Jesus' lap? 

- You'd squish it.

- Manny, next year we'll talk about 

- some of your little Colombian traditions.

-  Okay? Maybe. - I know what "Maybe" Means.

- It's like you're trying to take away my whole Christmas.

- I can't believe it's all gone. 

- Dad never follows through.

- Are you sure one of your friends didn't burn the couch?

- Hey, don't look at me.

- Only one of us was ever caught playing with matches.

- Luke?  

- That was a year ago. Just admit you did it.

-  You admit you did it! - No!

- Okay. Look, I have an idea.

- Do you remember the movie Spartacus?

- Here's what we do: 

- Luke, you tell Mom and Dad it's your fault.

-  I didn't do it. - It doesn't matter.

- Because after you confess,

- Haley and I will each confess to the same thing.

- How does that do anything?

- They'll be so touched that we're protecting each other...

- that they'll have to bring back Christmas.

- That's awesome.

- How does it work again?

- We're gonna pass into legend.

- The parents who canceled Christmas. 

- I thought you'd be happy.

- They'II write songs about us,

- make one of those Christmas specials with those ugly little clay people.

- You're the one who always says

- I shouldn't be such a pushover with the kids.

- So this is where you decide to make your stand?

-  Really, Phil? - Okay. Okay, look.

- Don't worry. We're going to have Christmas.

- We've raised our kids right. 

- Whoever did it will come forward.

- Or the other two will rat 'em out.

- Mom, Dad.

- Hey, Luke. What, uh- What can we do for you?

- I did it.

- I was playing with matches. I'm sorry.

- You, uh- You did the right thing- Yeah.

- by confessing, but, um

- This is bad, buddy.

- I mean, really bad, okay?

- Claire, you want to handle this?

- Um, Luke, why didn't you say something?

- Mmm, I don't know.

- Okay, well, your father and I are extremely disappointed in you,

- so- go up to your room. Go on.

- Alex!

- We'll be up to talk to you in a minute. Just go.

-  Haley! - What?

-  Say something! - About what?

-  Uh, I take it back! - What is going on?

- These guys were gonna say they did it too,

- and you were gonna be proud of all of us.

- Why would we do that?

- I don't know what to believe with this kid.

- Liars! I didn't do it!

-  Well, it wasn't me. - Don't look at me.

-  Seriously? - Wait.

- Nobody did it again?

- No, that's fine.

- Guess what? Christmas is still canceled.

- That's fine by me.

- Let's start working on next year.

- Hey, and memo to New Year's Eve... and Easter

- Watch your back!

- So, after I left the marines, I just kinda traveled the world.

- Now I go from town to town picking up odd jobs.

- Oh. Kinda like the Hulk.

- That's weird. That was my nickname in the corps

- 'cause of my bad temper.

- Anyway, thanks for having me over,

- having me for dinner, letting me do my laundry.

- It's not been a good day.

- Um, Scott, I-I have a confession to make. 

- Um, I didn't, uh

- I didn't clean the lint tray,

- so, um, your clothes might be a little pilly.

- Oh, no problem. That's the least of my worries.

- Thanks for everything. You guys made my day.

-  It's the least we could do. - What do you mean?

- I don't know... what I was saying.

-  I just say we never tell him. - Exactly.

- We give him some money, a hot meal, laundry.

- I think we're square.

- Agreed. Okay, how does this thing work?

- I think you just press that button right there in the middle. Yeah.

-  Oh, my  - Okay. That...

- That seems a little high, doesn't it?

- Yes. I'm not putting Lily in that.

- It's like something astronauts train in.

- Ho, ho, ho! It's me! Ho, ho, ho! It's me!

-  It's your dad. - Yeah.

- Hey, Dad.

- I brought your presents.

- Aren't we seeing you tomorrow, Jay?

- These are your Christmas Eve gifts.

-  You know the drill. - Oh, yeah.

- You open those up before bedtime. They're pajamas.

- Still keeping traditions alive, huh?

- Well, someone has to.

- I got two Colombians at home

- trying to turn Christmas into Cinco de Mayo.

- You know that's Mexican, right?

- Ah, burrito, "Bur-right-o."

- Christmas should be Christmas.

- Picture on the stairs, hot chocolate, opening the presents.

- That was supposed to be

- the good thing about having a kid in the house again.

- I can have Christmas the way we used to.

- I hear you, Jay.

- If I was home right now,

- I'd be mixin' up a bathtub full of eggnog

- and trying to squeeze a greased hog into a Santa hat.

- You don't think I miss that?

- Do you?

- The point is that those are memories that I'll always have,

- but now I have the perfect opportunity...

- to create new memories with my new family...

- that are gonna be just as special someday.

- Aw. No. Cam's right, you know.

- We create new traditions every year.

- So, who's ready to try the swing?

- Okay, now remind me. 

- We put this in the oven first thing tomorrow

- 'cause Jay wants to eat at 3:00.

- Ay, Manny! Did you put this spider in the fridge?

- Oh, yeah. Inocente.

- Ay, papi, what's wrong?

- I want to have Christmas like they do in Colombia.

- Jay is messing everything up.

- Manny, try to understand.

- Jay has great memories with his kids when they were young.

- And he just wants to recreate them with you.

- So, maybe the best gift I could give Jay would be...

- Christmas like he used to have it?

- Ay, you're such a beautiful boy!

- One day you're gonna grow up, and I'm gonna miss...

- all the things that you used to do as a little boy.

- Okay. But if this so-called Santa Claus...

- doesn't bring me a burgundy dinner jacket,

- we're going to have a big problem.

- Honey?

- Would it really be so bad to back down?

- And have the kids never take any of our threats seriously again?

- Yeah.

- Or... the kids could realize...

- that we're making a supreme sacrifice by giving up our power 

- to save their Christmas.

- Which would, in a way, be

- the greatest gift that we could ever give them.

- And which would paradoxically make them respect us even more.

- Okay, forget that. Go back one.

- Hey, guys.

- It- it was me.

-  What? - What?

- I found a cigarette at school,

- and when no one was home, I- I tried it.

- And I-I guess I held it too close to the couch.

- I'm so sorry.

- You can take my Christmas away,

- but don't take it from everyone else.

- That is very noble of you to care about the family,

- but you still smoked and lied.

- That's really bad. 

-  Now help me grab the tree. - Phil.

- Phil, Alex, come on back.

- Starting December 26, you are grounded for a full week,

- and that includes New Year's Eve.

-  But, I was  - Yeah, non-negotiable. So...

- Fine.

- Everybody!

- It's official! Christmas is back on!

-  It is? - What happened?

- Doesn't matter.

- Stockings, lights, ornaments, wreath!

-  Go, go, go! - Okay.

- Well, that sounds like a stressful job to me.

- Not as much as you'd think.

- They always made sure one of us had a blank,

- so nobody knew who took the fatal shot.

- This was mighty tasty.

- Well, I don't want to overstay my welcome.

- You won't have me back.

- You guys enjoy the rest of your night.

- You're good people.

- Scott. Wait, wait.

- Don't forget your laundry.

- Oh! Thanks. Thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks.

- Merry Christmas.

- Scott, merry Christmas to you, too.

- And happy. Son of a bitch.

-  What? - Oh. It's the New Greensleevers.

- They're Cameron's old caroling group.

- They kicked him out this year.

- I mean, it is one thing to kick me out of the group,

- but to rub my nose in it!

- I'm turning on the sprinklers.

- Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

- I know it feels good to get even.

- Believe me.

- To see the fear in a man's eyes is

- but there's something that feels even better.

- Forgiveness.

- Scott, you don't understand. 

- This- this group was my Dreamgirls.

- I was Effie.

- You know what the best thing I did all day was?

- Forgiving you for getting me fired.

- Andrew.

- Ensemble.

- Uh, I know it's no accident that you're here on my street tonight.

- And I- I just wanted to say to you all that you sound great.

- And... merry Christmas.

- Even your apology is off-key.

- Not cool, buddy.

- Well, I should, uh, probably scoot.

- But- but- but what about forgiveness?

- You were nice. He was naughty.

- Where were you for so long?

- Just a little last-minute shopping.

-  What's this? - Bunuelos.

-  Who? What? - Cheese fritters.

- It's a Colombian traditional Christmas food.

- Okay, new rule: From now on...

- we do Colombian things when we're in Colombia.

- We do American things when we're in America.

- That means no more of your food,

- no more of your music...

- and especially no more of your crazy holidays!

-  Inocente! - Ay, Jay!

- What? Did I say it wrong? 

- You two are total inocentes!

- You should see the look on your faces.

- And by the way- You know how

- hard it is to get fireworks on Christmas Eve?

- Go, Manny. Thank you.

- All righty. Here's another one for Luke.

-  Looks like a book. - I have a book already.

- What is that? Oh, my God. The couch is smoking.

- It's sunlight.

- It's the ornament.

- Cool. It's like a magnifying glass.

- Hey, how weird is that? It's burning a hole...

- in the exact same spot that Alex was smoking in.

- Oh, Haley.

- Alex, why'd you take the blame?

- I didn't want to lose Christmas.

- That is so stinking beautiful.

- Get in here.

-  No. - Yes.

-  Oh, no. - Yes.

-  Oh, yes! - Bear hug!

- Wait a- You were going to take

- Christmas away for something that none of us did?

- Well, um, Christmas is about moving forward.

- I've never heard that.

- Actually, honey, you did kinda shoot your mouth off.

- You called us all liars. 

- Yeah, you did, and then...

- Let's not all get worked up. I made a mistake!

- I made a mistake. And people make mistakes.

- And they make up for those mistakes

- by... taking their family to Italy!

- Oh, my God! Yeah!

-  Can Dylan come? - Yeah! Yeah!

- Who wants some dark meat?

- We talk a lot about tradition this time of year.

- But as much as we love our traditions,

- sometimes our best memories come

- from the times that are the most untraditional.

- Inocente!

- We remember the year Mom and Dad went crazy.

- We remember the year Santa punched out the caroler.

- But for me, this was the year that the word "Tradition"...

- got a lot bigger.

- There's Cam.

- Ah, you didn't.

- You got me again.

S01E11 
----------------------
- What's the most irritating thing my parents say to me?

- "That's too much cologne."

- "That's how girls end up dead."

- "Don't talk black to me."

- "It's inappropriate because she's your teacher."

- How do you even talk black?

- End words with "Izzle"? 

- It's "Talk back," You idiot.

- "Act more like an adult."

- What does "Act more like an adult" even mean?

- Look at you, you're soaked! That is so lame.

- You're the one who wanted to do it!

- What are you two doing?

- Oh, I picked up one of those Water Weasels.

- You hook it on the end

- of the hose and it flies around in the air.

- Just like a weasel. 

- Yeah. Look at how awesome. He's so wet.

- I put the weasel in my pants.

-  He totally did. - Dork!

- Is there a reason why my window's wet?

-  Hmm. Very difficult to say. - I don't know.

-  Up top- Ow! Ow! - What's wrong?

-  Little- - Sweetie, you okay?

- Little twinge. Yeah.

- I'll call 911.

- Maybe the firemen will come.

-  No, no! No, no! - Give me it!

- The firemen in our town have a reputation for being hot.

- Do I resent that? 

- Of course not. These guys are my friends.

- I play basketball with them. I bake for 'em.

- My question is: What's hot?

- Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

- Coming.

- Manny, it's inappropriate because it's your teacher.

- What's the big deal anyway?

- It's a surprise. You'll see. 

- Oh, my God!

-  Ay, Jay, you didn't? - Yes, I did.

- I got us into that new Benihana.

- They got a chef there that can flip a shrimp into his own hat.

- What the hell?

-  Dad! - There's my boy!

-  The hell is he doing here? - Jay.

- No. He was supposed to pick up manny yesterday 

- and disappointed him again, as usual.

- Now he just sails in here out of the blue?

- I don't like the guy. Do I have reasons? Yeah.

- Good reasons? Yeah.

- How many reasons do I need? 

- None. I don't like the guy.

- So I would have called,

- but while I was buying this boat for a friend,

- I got chased out to sea by another boat "Tiqui tiqui".

- Were they pirates?

-  I didn't stop to ask. - Well, it's not hard to tell.

- Did they have curvy swords and

- sing songs about how fun it is to be a pirate?

- Jay. Such a beautiful house, huh?

- So, we were just headed out to dinner.

- What, you think I show up empty-handed?

- I brought dinner- lobsters!

-  Did you catch them with your bare hands? - No.

- But I bought them with my bare hands.

- And I have some nice wine, a good Cuban cigar for Jay.

- Hey, why don't you take a picture of him with your new camera phone.

-  I don't have a camera phone. - You do now.

- Awesome!

- All of this excitement, my heart is just going.

- Now, listen to me. 

- You bring that with you when you come visit me this summer.

- We'll go in a race car with my friend,

- and after that, maybe a bullfight.

- I know all these guys. 

- The matadors, they're like artists.

- You're quite the bullfight artist yourself.

- I, uh- Manny, why don't you show your father to the kitchen?

- Por favor. Dios mo. Someone put on some music.

- Tonight, we dance!

- Oh, we're gonna dance.

- Oye, mi amor, est bien que me quede aqu esta noche?

- Ay, Javier, yo no s. Esprate para ver qu puedo hacer.

- What did he say? Does he need money for the lobsters?

-  Jay, be nice. - "Be nice."

- I could be sitting grill-side,

- watching a guy build an onion volcano.

- Instead, I got Rico Suave in my kitchen,

- and I got a stolen boat in my driveway.

- If it was for me, he'd be out of my life.

- But it's good for Manny to be with his father.

- I just can't believe you ever fell for that act.

- Colombians can be very persuasive.

- They can make you agree to things before you even know it.

- You must have been pretty naive.

- Yeah. But now I'm with the right man, okay? 

- Right.

- Javier is only going to stay one night.

- Good.

- Wait, what?

- Don't be mad. I just got up to change her.

- Well, Mitchell really wanted to Ferberize the baby.

- Ferberize. It is a method of

- getting the baby to sleep through the night...

- by, yes, basically letting her cry herself to sleep.

- Torture. 

- It's not torture, Cam.

- It's just hard if you happen to be a person

- who hates to hear another person suffer.

- Or two people suffer.

- No, no. You got up to comfort her,

- which only teaches her that every time she cries,

- her daddy will come in and cuddle her and put on her favorite

- What are we watching?

- Brian De Palma's controversial masterpiece

- Scarface.

- For the baby?

- She happens to like it.

- I don't know if it's the colors or the sounds

- Oh, here comes the nightclub massacre. She loves it.

- Watch her little eyelids. 

- It's so cute. They get so heavy.

- Oh, that's bad.

-  Oh, honey. - I'm fine. No, I'm fine.

- I'm just- Okay, that's cancer.

- Maybe it's just a kidney stone. 

- "Just," Claire?

- What's going on, guys?

- It's nothing. Go back to bed.

-  No, but Dad... - Don't touch me.

- I bet it's just a kidney stone. 

- "Just" Again.

- Someone get your mom a glass of water...

- and a piece of gravel from the driveway and see how she likes it.

- Why is everybody yelling?

- Something's wrong with Dad.

- Don't frighten him. Come here.

- Oh, that's gotta be death! Death is coming!

-  Okay, you need to go to the hospital. - Yeah.

- No, no, no. I just need a pill.

- Give me the biggest one you can find.

- Honey, breathe. Just-Just breathe.

- That's what I told you when youwere in labor

- and you threw my smoothie at me. Pill!

-  Okay, I'm calling. - No, no, it's fine!

- It's actually- It's fine. It's passing. It's passing.

- I am sorry to alarm everyone.

- I think I was probably just overreacting,

- because there's an alien inside of me!

- Oh, my God.

-  Oh, close it down. - I am definitely gonna call.

- All systems down. All systems down.

-  Son of a bitch. - What's the matter?

- He's playing on my pool table, that's what.

- Probably got himself a nice drink too. 

- Where you going, Jay?

-  Just to check things out, okay? - Come on.

- You hear that? Now he's messing around with my remote control.

- You can't hear that from here!

- Hey, there.

- Hey, Jay. Listen, I'm sorry. Did I wake you up?

- No. No, I'm a light sleeper.

-  That's what happens when you get older. - Oh, you're not old.

- I didn't say I was old.

- I never sleep much anyway.

- Life is just more interesting after 2:00 A.M.

- You know, the liquor tastes better,

- the, uh, women are more beautiful.

- What is it they say?

- That the night belongs to the poets and the madmen.

-  Which are you? - Perhaps both.

- And I think maybe you too, huh?

- I see a picture over here of you on a motorcycle.

-  You ride? - I used to.

- Used to? Used to?

- Jay, 

- the saddest words in any language, my friend.

- Hey, help me out here. 

- Everybody sees you as this great guy.

- You know, you live this life of adventure.

- How come I don't buy a word of it?

- All I see is a dad who doesn't show up.

- Hey, Manny knows me. I live in the now.

- Well, I was living in the yesterday 

- when Manny was crying outside that door...

- cause you didn't show up for the 10th time.

- And when I don't come, you think,

- uh- what, I'm just off chasing a good time, hmm?

- You ever think it might be hard for me, coming here?

- Why? Because of Gloria?

- Because of you.

- Cam!

- Okay, they're on their way.

- Okay, kids, gather around.

- Like you're hugging me, but don't touch me, okay?

- Now look, I'm gonna be fine.

- We know, Dad.

- We don't know that.

- It's a miracle I'm standing up.

- But look, in case anything happens

- I want you to know that if I'd had time,

- I would have fixed that step.

-  Thanks, Dad. - I love you.

- Don't cry, Luke. I'm okay.

- I broke the coffee table!

- That's okay. 

- What?

- I broke the glass coffee table.

- The one you swore you didn't break,

- and then we blamed Esperanza and fired her...

- and she stole a turkey at Thanksgiving for her family 

- and got deported?

-  Yeah. - Damn it!

-  I'm sorry. - You will be sorry!

-  They're here!  - Really?

- Did you hear that?

- Luke broke the

- Hey, you changed your clothes.

- Well, I had- I had to get dressed.

- Into that sexy, clingy- 

- Oh, my God. It's the firemen.

- No, sweetie.

- And lipstick!

- I'm out here convulsing in agony 

- and you're looking for cute tops to wear?

- I just threw on the first thing I could find.

- We got a minute, if you wanna try on some tighter jeans

- Oh, Phil, sweetie. 

- Oh, no. By all means, Claire, 

- we want you looking your sexiest...

- when the hunky, gay firemen get here!

-  How we doing? - We're great.

-  He meant me! - All right.

- Cameron!

- No, listen, Jay. You're a tough guy to compete with.

- I mean, look at all you have.

- So Manny has to suffer? 

- No. You're right.

- Look, I'm going to try harder.

- But maybe it's a good thing that he has the two of us.

- From you, he learns stability.

- From me, he learns how to be spontaneous,

- grab life by the throat.

- Well, we do a little throat grabbing ourselves around here, you know.

- We were on our way to Benihana when you showed up.

- Hey, as long as my boy follows his passion.

- The worst career decision I ever made

- was playing baseball, but I loved every minute of it.

- You played baseball?

- I lived baseball.

- I only made it to Triple-A,

- but I played with all those guys- Sosa, McGwire.

- You look like you played some.

- I played in high school.

- I was all right. Never hit a curve ball.

- So that's a dream of yours?

- To- To hit a curve?

- Used to be.

- "Used to be." Por favor. 

- I said that again, right?

- Hey, please. Come on. 

- You're right, I shouldn't say that.

- What are you guys doing?

- Manny, did we wake you up? I'm sorry.

- No. I was doing my science extra credit.

-  Of course you were. - So, can I play?

- That's up to your dad.

- Actually, I think we're done with pool for right now.

- I have a better idea for the three of us. Vamos.

- So, how do you know this guy? 

- He owes me a little favor.

- This is the coolest night ever!

- Now, let's see about that curve ball.

-  Out. - I thought you were

- Those were pillows. Come on. Come on.

- Cameron, do you realize how infuriating this is?

- The whole point of Ferberizing...

- is to teach her to put herself to sleep,

- and you keep ruining it.

- I can't help it. I'm like a mother bear.

- When I hear my cub crying, I have to run to her.

- Except you're not a bear. Get in our room.

- Get- Cam, get in there. Get in there.

-  Cut it out. - All the way- Our room.

- Get! Get in there.

- Come on. Come on. Get in there. Get!

- That's so unfair. Why not?

- Because that's how girls end up dead.

-  Hey, honey. - Hey, guys.

- We just wanted to see how you're doing.

- Is this a bad time?

- No, we're just giving him something to relax before the procedure.

- Which is gonna go just fine.

-  Oh, we know. - We don't know.

- In case it doesn't,

- promise me you'll be nice to your new fireman daddy.

- Unbelievable.

- My wife got dressed up for the firemen last night.

- I didn't get dressed up for the firemen.

- Those heels were really hot.

-  You put on heels? - Let's drop it.

- What are they doing to you, Dad?

- I have a little scratchy rock inside of me

- and they're sliding in a tube and sucking it out.

- You're not scared, are you?

- When was the last time you saw your old man scared?

- When you walked through the spiderweb.

- When we were playing with the Ouija board

- and the wind blew the door shut.

- There was no wind, buddy. We brought something forth.

- Oh. This stuff's really hitting me.

- My insides feel like velvet.

- Why don't you guys wait out in the hallway, okay?

-  Feel better, Dad. - I will.

-  Love you, Dad. - Love you.

-  Love you. - Luke, buddy, hold back a sec.

- This is not gonna happen, okay,

- but there is a scenario

- where you could be the man of the house...

- and you need to know all the PIN numbers and passwords.

-  741 - I don't wanna be the man of the house.

- Now, don't talk black to me.

- Honey, your dad's gonna be fine.

- Why don't you wait out in the hall. He'll be fine, okay?

- Honey, I'm just gonna run them to school.

- I'll be back right after.

-  Okay. Claire? - Yeah.

- You did get dressed up, didn't you?

- I pulled on the first thing I saw, okay? 

- Okay, I'll drop it

- 'cause this stuff is making me fall asleep.

- And if I never wake up, I'd hate

- for the last thing you ever said to me to be a lie.

- I might have gotten dressed up just a tiny bit.

-  I knew it. - Oh, damn it!

- Manny, we're gonna be late for school.

- Why are you so tired today?

- Any reason I can't take him?

- I'm surprised you're up. 

- I know what time you went back to bed.

- Oh, it was nothing. We just went out, we hit a few balls.

- And you'll never guess where.

- I guess Javier knew a guy.

- And you know what?

- Now that he knows you,

- the next time he needs something, you are the guy.

- Ay, Dios mo. Did you took him with you?

- You couldn't wait to get to school to do that?

- Manny, vamonos para el colegio.

- Let's go. We're gonna be so late. Vamonos.

- Vamos a llegar tardsimo, Manny,

- qu te pasa? Get in the car.

- I thought you said you wanted me to bond with Javier.

- I said be nice, Jay.

- I didn't say take Manny up all night and play games.

-  Then we got hot dogs. - Ay. Go to sleep!

- If I wanted to be married to a wild man,

- I would have stayed with Javier.

- Qu pasa?

-  Dad! - Por dios, no.

- What the hell?

- Wait a minute.

-  You're not leaving, are you? - I've got school.

-  What? School? - Yes, school.

- That's where people go to learn things,

- like not to keep children up all night.

-  He told her? - He's weak.

- Well, listen, you said you used to like riding motorcycles, right?

- So I brought you one.

-  I know. But I kind of got work. - Work.

-  Go, Jay. - Yeah, go.

- Yes, go, Jay, and take Manny with you too!

- Okay.

- No, Manuel Alberto!

- In the car or I put you in the trunk!

- Jay, I'm not gonna argue anymore.

- I'm not gonna say anything else. Do whatever you want.

- But I don't wanna hear you any more saying that Colombians are crazy,

- 'cause you're the one that is acting crazy,

- even though he's the one that is making you act crazy.

- So I don't know what the hell I'm talking about! Manny!

- You didn't need to come home during nap time.

- Think we proved last night that I did.

- Well, she's back there now, so why don't you go,

- so you don't get in trouble.

- That's okay. I told everyone 

- that I have an unreliable partner,

- and, uh, they understood.

- You know what? I don't need to sit here and be condescended to.

- I'm gonna make myself an ice tea.

- I will bring you down.

- You can't bring me down.

- I'll sweep your legs.

- There's something wrong with you...

- that the sound of our child in such distress

- doesn't bother you more.

- She's not in distress,

- and this just proves that you need this more than she does.

- I'm Ferberizing two babies.

- Raccoons slipped into the lawsons' home 

- and stole a loaf of bread.

- Your point?

- That we left Lily's window open a crack,

- and those raccoons need something to put between that bread,

- and that is Lily's "Help me" Cry.

-  I'm coming for you, Lily. - No, you're not.

- You are not coming, Cameron.

- Let me go! Hey, stop it!

- Let go! Get off me! What are you doing?

-  Stop! - I will not stop.

- Stop being such a baby. I'm coming for you!

-  What? - Oh, my ankle.

- My ankle.

- Ay! I guess you didn't kill yourself in the motorcycle today.

- Well, I figured you were looking forward to killing me,

- so I'm not gonna take that away from you.

- Hey, did Javier call you?

- No, why?

- He's dragging me to this bar with some of his old baseball pals.

- He was supposed to be here at 5:00.

-  Ah, he's dragging you, huh? - Yeah.

- I figured it would be okay.

- I've seen half these guys play.

- Javier says it's cool.

-  What? What's the joke? - Nothing.

- It's just funny to me... that you make fun of me

- because I was seduced by him,

- but here you are

- No one is getting seduced.

- I'm doing this for Manny.

- Yeah, it's very important for Manny

- that you two go and have a nice picnic in the mountains.

- First of all, it wasn't a picnic. We stopped for coffee.

- They just happened to be selling crepes.

- Listen. Let me know when he calls, all right?

- Geez, it's almost 6:00.

- The kids are so excited for you to come home.

- Oh, me too.

- Yeah, Luke made you a sign.

-  Oh, he's a sweetie. - Yeah. You seem great.

-  I am great. - Good.

- Except for that fireman thing.

-  You remember it? - Mm-hmm.

-  Yeah, okay. Look, I am sorry. I'm so sorry. - Ah, no.

- There's no excuse for it.

- I think I just spend so much time in dowdy mom clothes,

- and I'm covered in paste and peanut butter,

- and I just- I wanted to feel attractive for a second, you know?

- I'm sorry. I really

- Honey, I just need a little bit of time.

-  Gonna be fine. - Okay.

-  Yeah. - Okay.

- I was already fine with it.

- Here's the deal: Claire messed up.

- She owed me.

- This never happens.

- Old Phil has a golden ticket.

- Now, I could have cashed that in right away for something small

- get out of cleaning the garage, a week at circus camp.

-  Still fresh. - Yeah.

- But the longer you hold on to it, the more the guilt builds,

- the more you get.

- Five years: Trip to Paris with my buddies.

- Ten years: Sweet little convertible.

- Twenty years:

- Hello, fully articulating, five-function robot...

- that can read my mind and has feelings.

- Phil, you're not leaving without saying good-bye, are you?

- Hey, Elaine.

-  Is this your husband? - Uh-huh.

-  Good-bye, Paris. - I'm visiting my sister...

- and he was entertaining us all afternoon with his card tricks.

-  Is that Phil? - Hey.

- Hey, Mom, Phil's leaving.

-  Without a hug? - Wow.

- Good-bye, fully articulating,

- five-function robot with the ability to- Good-bye.

- Brittany, hurry, honey. Phil's leaving.

- You're fine.

-  How's your ankle? - It's cold.

-  I'm sorry I hurt you. - No. No, don't be. I

- I could have just as easily hurt you.

- Well, it's cute that you think that.

- Listen, Cam, I- I can't always be the bad cop here.

- I-I know it's my issue,

- but she can't grow up with

- one huggy, happy, cuddly dad...

- and one frowny, lesson-teachy dad.

- Because guess which one

- she's gonna ask to walk her down the aisle.

- Uh- Y- Okay, you know what?

- I can be the bad cop sometimes.

- I'll always make her eat her vegetables.

-  Okay. Dentist. - Deal.

-  Good. - As long as you make her practice her violin.

- Oh, yeah. The violin. I like that.

- And we're both walking her down the aisle.

- Assuming you can walk by then.

- Do you need to go to the hospital for that?

- No, God. No, no. It's not that bad.

- Oh, you meant call 911, didn't you?

- Firemen.

- Yeah, you call, and I'm gonna change my shirt.

- So, if I'm supposed to act like an adult,

- is that act like adults I see in the world

- Or the adults in my family?

- 'Cause if it's the ones in my family

-  Come on. Let's go. - All right.

- Then...

- how hard could that be?

- Doing the card tricks at the hospital

- really got me fired up about my magic again.

- Is this your card?

- Yes. Oh, my gosh.

- It's- It's not, is it?

- No, uh, no. It's not.

- The hardest part is when people forget their card,

- because then I look like the idiot.

-  All right. Let's do it again. - We really have to go.

-  You think I like this? - I'm sorry.

- Here. I'm gonna teach you one, okay?

- On the count of three, just grab this. You ready?

-  Put your hand out. - Okay.

- One, two, three. There it is.

- No. What was that? 

- Thank you.

- Are you kidding me?

S01E12 
----------------------
S01E13 
----------------------
- Can people change?

- Well, that's a- that is a tough one,

- but I would say yes. People can change.

- That's what I believe anyway, and I will till the day I die.

- You do realize you're proving the exact opposite of your point?

- See? She's changed. She used to be very supportive of me.

- Come on.

- Phil!

-  Ow! Ow! Why is it so loud? - My ears are bleeding!

-  Why is it so loud? - I don't know! Make it stop!

- I just installed a sweet home theater system in the family room.

- The, um- the trouble is Claire struggles...

- with technology of any kind.

- I mean, remotes, cell phones, computers.

- Haley, have you seen my blue

-  Hey, Mrs. Dunphy. - Oh, hey, Dylan.

- You know I can see you, right?

- No, I did not know that.

- Haley's just in the bathroom. She'll be back in just a minute.

- Thank you.

-  Where were you pointing it? - At the TV.

- This

- Honey- Uh, no. I'm sorry.

- It's-It's a home theater.

- What, so I can't point it at the TV

- when I want to watch the TV?

- No. You point it at the receiver.

- What's a receiver?

- Okay, imagine our home theater system is a human body.

- So then the receiver is the brain.

-  The TV is the face. - I know what part you are.

- So he says to his wife, "you don't love me anymore?"

- His heart- boom! 

- Quadruple bypass. Blown a valve.

-  Hey! Look who it is. - Hey. There he is.

- What a coinkydink.

- I was just getting some flowers for Gloria 

- for babysitting Lily.

- You want me to take 'em to her?

- I would, but I have the most hilarious card for her at home.

- It's- It's a hunky Antonio Banderas type

- in silk boxers.

- And on the inside, it says, "thank you for last noche,

- but I can't find my pantalones."

- I'm not doing it justice, really.

- Hi. I'm Cameron. 

- Oh, geez. I'm sorry. Guys, this is Cameron.

-  He's a... friend of my son's. - Hey.

- This is, uh, Scotty, Dale, Hugo and Shorty.

- It's nice to meet you guys.

- You guys look like a scene out of Jersey Boys.

-  Ay! So handsome! - Thank you.

- Manny, are you wearing aftershave? 

- Yes, for my date.

- This will be the first time she will ever smell me.

- Her name is Whitney.

- I met her in an online book club.

- We both like vampire fiction...

- and the romance of eternal life.

- I think it's adorable that Manny has a date.

- He even picked out the lunch menu

- grilled-cheese sandwich and tomato soup.

- Tomato soup because, you know, the tomato soup is like the blood.

- And the vampires like to eat the blood.

- And then he wants me to take them out for ice cream,

- well, because Manny likes ice cream.

- Oh, that must be her. If this goes well,

- you don't need to stick around.

- Hi. I'm Whitney. I'm here for Manny.

- See how that works?

- Sorry, sweetie. Sorry, Daddy. 

- No, it's all right.

- We were just- me and Lily were just using the time...

- to figure out how to use the car's voice-command thingy.

- Oh. Here. Check it out. Watch.

- CD player. Next track.

-  Say a command. - No.

- CD player. Next track.

- Air conditioner on.

- Damn it. 

- You're worse than your sister with this kind of stuff.

- It's a good thing Lily doesn't have an ejector seat.

- Oh, guess what. I ran into your dad and some of his friends.

-  Oh, really? - Yeah. And get this.

- He, uh- He referred to me as "a friend of my son."

-  Seriously? - Yeah.

- That's a little disrespectful to you.

-  I wasn't offended by it. - Well- I am.

- I mean, would he refer to Phil as "a friend of Claire's"? No.

- I've heard him call Phil a lot worse.

- Just let it pass. I should have never said anything.

- I'm not letting it pass. He needs to know that's not okay.

- And if he doesn't like it, he knows where he can go.

-  Enter destination. - Hell!

-  Mexican food. - Shut up!

- I came out of the closet in my mid-20s.

- I had to actually come out to my dad three times...

- before he finally acknowledged it.

- I'm not sure if maybe he was hoping he heard it wrong,

- like I had said, "Dad, I'm gray."

- And my parents, they always just knew.

- My mother says labor with me took 36 hours...

- because I came out of the womb like this- "Hello!"

-  I gotta lay off these cannolis. - Hey, dad.

- Mitchell. Hey, you guys know my son, Mitch.

-  Hey, Mitch, how they hangin'? - Hey, Mitch.

- Hey, hey, hey. That's a great coat.

-  Where'd you get that? - I don't know. It was a gift.

- Really? What is it- suede, microsuede?

- Some kind of lambskin? It's very soft, you know.

- Thank you.

-  Uh, can I talk to you for a second? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

-  Thanks. Good seeing you. - Be right back.

- What's the matter?

- Um, "a friend of my son"? That's how you introduce Cam?

- That's why you came here?

- Dad, it's just more than a little insulting.

- Cam and I have been together for five years.

- We- We have a daughter.

- Look at these guys.

- They look like they came out of the 1800s.

- You see Hugo over there?

- After lunch, he ordered a Sanka.

- No, they're not the ones that are uncomfortable with this. You are.

- You've never been completely accepting of me.

- And now that I have a family, it's getting a little old.

- These guys don't understand the gay thing.

- Why create an awkward situation? That's all I'm saying.

- That's weird,

- because your friend Shorty there- gay as they come.

-  You gotta be kiddin'.  - No.

- My gaydar is never wrong,

- and it is pinging like we're at a bathhouse.

- What are you talking about- gay? The guy used to be married.

- Okay, that makes- So did Elton John,

- Merv Griffin, Cole Porter.

- You know what? Listen. You couldn't be more wrong about this.

- No, Dad. You could not be more wrong- about a lot of things.

-  Good seeing you guys. - You take care, man.

-  That's a great coat. - Yeah, later.

- Ping!

-  Phil Dunphy. - Hey, it's me.

-  Hey. - Listen, I've got a bunch of moms over here...

- who wanna watch the talent show DVD,

- and I can't get the sound to work.

-  Is there a picture? - Yes.

- Be honest. Did you do that thing where you get frustrated...

- and you start pressing all the buttons?

- No.

- I have a theory that Phil installs...

- overly complicated things in the house...

- just so he has an excuse to talk to me like a child.

- Last month, it was the thermostat.

- The snowflake button makes it cold, cold, cold 

- "Set temperature" makes it hold, hold, hold 

- The little flame makes it hot

- This is so humiliating.

-  I am sorry. - It's okay.

- He just seemed so mature online.

-  How could I be so stupid? - You're not stupid.

- "Stupid" is not following your heart and taking a chance on love.

- I mean, what kind of 11-year-old talks like that?

- Manny's an old soul.

- Here. Use my handkerchief.

- You see what I mean?

- I'll just be alone for the rest of my life.

-  And that's okay. - No, don't say that.

- In my country, there's a saying that means...

- "Love is just around the corner."

- I come from a neighborhood with a lot of prostitutes.

- Maybe for you.

- I mean, men must throw themselves at you every day.

- They'II do the same for you if you just

- Just what? Put out?

- No. Just

- like, the lipstick, the hair, push-up bra. You know.

- What's it matter? I'm never gonna be as pretty as you.

- Ay, believe me, this takes a lot of work.

- You just need to find your inner beauty.

- It's hiding beneath a mask of insecurity.

- Okay, he's starting to freak me out.

- Manny, go play.

- Mitchell, how do these look to you?

-  Like they're dying. - I know. Right?

- I said something to the florist. He said,

- "Don't worry about it. They're gonna come back."

- They're not coming back. They've crossed to the other side.

-  You are a funny man. - Why?

- You're completely bothered by the flowers.

- But when my father introduces you as "a friend of my son,"

- doesn't faze you in the least.

- Because the florist played me for a fool.

- Your dad didn't mean any harm. He's just being who he is.

- When I was back East in law school,

- my dad used to call me every Saturday at 6:00 p.M.,

- before people would go out,

- just to, you know, check in, catch up.

- And then, I think, the Christmas of my second year,

- I finally got up the courage to tell him.

- After that, I-I... pretty much just talked to my mom.

- Don't cry.

- I'm not crying.

-  I'm home! - We're here.

- This is Whitney. We're giving her a makeover.

- Hi. You have such a nice family...

- and a really beautiful house.

- Thanks. You two know each other how?

- She's my date.

- Of course she is. I'll be in here.

- I'll be right back.

- I'm sorry this didn't turn out like you wanted.

- That's okay.

- Probably didn't turn out how you wanted it either.

- I'll tell you what. 

- If neither of us is with anybody in 10 years,

- how about you and me give it a shot?

- That's disturbing.

- But maybe.

-  How was your lunch with the boys? - Good.

-  Ran into Mitchell and Cam. - Ay, nice.

- You're not gonna believe this.

-  Mitchell says Shorty's gay. - Shorty?

-  Yeah, I believe it. - Oh, come on!

- Well, he's a great dresser, a great dancer. 

- That doesn't prove anything.

- He's the only one of your friends that never hits on me. 

- My friends hit on you?

- Yes, all the time, but don't worry.

- They're a bunch of harmless old men.

- They're my age.

- I'm sure it's very hard on Shorty to keep a secret like that.

-  Jay, I think you should talk to him. - What?

- You're the only one with a gay son.

- I'm sure he'll appreciate opening up to you.

- We're guys. We don't open up.

- We talk about sports and cars,

- getting up in the middle of the night to pee.

- I'm sure you made it very easy for Mitch to come out of the closet.

-  Yeah. - Okay. I'm gonna finish my makeover.

- Because I care about people.

- Because I want to help them change their lives.

- Jay, I'm hinting that you should call your friend, okay?

-  Yes. I'm getting that. - Okay, okay.

- Hey, hey! Daddy in the hizzouse!

- Why would you do that to a brand-new, very expensive remote?

- Because I lost my temper, and it didn't work.

- Therefore, it's useless.

- Well, honey, when it comes to anything electronic,

- you're not exactly the best student.

- I am very smart.

- I had a 4.0 in college. How about you?

- I was almost that despite my substantial time 

- commitment to cheerleading.

- I thought we agreed not to bring up the cheerleading.

- Cheerleading in my college was cool.

- The football players were so jealous,

- they wouldn't even let me and my buddies

- Trevor, Scotty and Ling- go to their parties.

- Seriously, Claire,

- you owe me an apology for breaking that.

- Okay. Phil, 

- I apologize for breaking the world's worst remote...

- that you bought... stupidly.

- Excuse me, 

- but the experts at CNET.Com rated it the best remote.

- They gave it three and a half mice.

- Wow. I have an idea. Let's invite the gang from CNET over...

- and your old buddies from cheerleading,

- and we can have a nerd party.

- Ling is not a nerd.

- He built his own helicopter.

- And if he was alive today

- Sweet pea, let's not talk about Ling.

- It upsets you too much.

-  You know what I'm gonna do? - Hmm?

- I'm gonna buy a new remote- the same remote.

- And just to prove how wrong you are,

- I'm gonna teach our dumbest kid 

- how to use it in 20 minutes or less.

-  Who's our dumbest kid? - Luke.

- Luke? No, Luke understands electronics.

- Haley.

-  No. - Yeah, Haley.

- Teach Haley to use the remote, and then I'll apologize.

-  Haley? - Mm-hmm.

- Come on!

- Hey, Shorty, it's me.

- I was thinking of heading over to the driving range 

- and hitting a few balls.

- You want to join me? 

- That's great, Jay. What should I wear?

- I don't know. Wear- Wear whatever you want.

- Oh, my God! Oh, God!

-  What? - The flowers.

- They look so much better! This is a disaster.

- You do know what "Disaster" means, right?

- You don't understand. I demanded that they come exchange them.

- I got all medieval on the florist.

- Cam, I heard you on the phone.

- You said you were displeased, but that's hardly going medieval.

- Excuse me. I said "Very displeased."

- And I used my cowboy voice, so

- What are you doing?

- I'm microwaving them so they look bad again.

- Well, that seems a little crazy, doesn't it?

- Oh, no! That's the florist.

- Relax. Just take them out. I'll get the door.

- He'll never know the difference.

- Hi. Florist.

-  Yes. Come on in. He's over there with the flowers. - Hello.

- I don't know what happened.

- They just, uh, somehow lost their vigor.

-  They were like this when we came home. - Cam. Cam.

- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

- Oh, my God! Oh! Oh! Oh, my God!

- God, God!

- Look at that. Two things flaming at once.

- Damn it!

-  You know what the problem is. - What?

- You're not moving your hips. They're frozen. 

- Hips?

- Yeah, your hips. They're frozen. Here, let me show you.

-  No, it's okay.  - No, no. - Don't fight me.

- All right, Shorty.

- Just bring the club back. Go ahead. All right?

- Now turn those hips. That's it. You just gotta relax.

- You gotta open up the stance a little bit.

- Spread 'em. Spread 'em.

- That's it. If you don't relax,

- you're never gonna get that shaft where it belongs.

- Hey, you know what? How about a coffee?

-  Let's get a coffee. - Sure.

- Now press the button labeled "Activities."

-  Where is that? - It's just to the right. - To the right.

-  And now choose "Watch DVD." - What?

- Honey, you gotta focus. We've only got 20 minutes.

- Pretend- Pretend the mall's closing.

- Dad, this is stupid. 

- I watch TV on my computer.

- Why do I have to learn this?

- Because your mom doesn't think you can.

- Nobody can.

- Haley, listen to me.

- Listen to me.

- I know this seems impossible.

- But this is for all those times 

- that Mom told you she was right...

- and you knew she was wrong.

-  I'll do it. - That's my girl.

- You know, that guy's got a beautiful stroke.

- Look at his pants- no pleats. I like pants like that.

- You think I can get away with something like that? 

- Sure. Why not?

- Listen, Shorty, uh, we know each other a long time, right?

-  What, 30 years? - Yeah.

- And, um, I sense that you got a secret...

- that's maybe causing you a lot of anguish.

- You heard something, right?

- Well, I had the same situation with my son, Mitchell.

- Really? 

- Yeah, and I didn't handle it too well either.

- And, uh, I just want you to know 

- that you can open up to me,

- that I'm gonna do all I can to help you.

- Well, I mean I

- I never said this out loud before to anyone.

- But I guess, if I did, it would be you.

- It's just that, Jay, you see, I'm, uh

- I'm

- Go ahead. Yeah. Go ahead.

-  I'm in debt. - Huh?

- I owe a bookie 20 G's, and he's a serious guy.

- And you offering to give me the dough- This is beautiful.

-  Wait a minute. You're not gay? - Gay?

- What are you talkin' about- gay?

- I'm not gay. Where'd you get gay?

- Come on. I mean, you're always

- talking about clothes and everything, right?

- My father was a tailor. I like clothes. 

- So what?

- Are you calling my father gay?

- No!

- My father landed on Normandy 

- to save your ass.

- You know, if you weren't lending me 20 G's,

- I'd knock you out right now.

- Take a check?

- Cash would be better.

- Haley. You ready?

- Let's do this.

- Turn on the TV.

-  Angela says, after he colored her hair- - Nice.

-  It turned gray and then green. - Mute it.

- Un-mute it.

- Sixty-five dollars.

-  Put on a DVD. - Hairdresser

- Frederick Longmire denies he's responsible.

-  Skip forward. - Wait.

- Okay. Back to TV.

- ...better than that.

- Face! 

- Don't get all cocky, Phil.

- Let's see what happens to little Haley...

- when I do... this.

- Ho, ho, ho. Ho! Face.

- Dad, wh- What do I do?

- Don't panic. We went through this. Just- Just think.

- Give up. Give up. Admit defeat.

-  Haley. -Okay. - Uh, let's see.

- You put the remote on to TV mode...

- and then press "Input"...

- till you get HDMI 1 and

-  I did it! - She did it!

- Fine. You proved your point.

- Everybody in this house is smarter than me.

- No, honey, you're missing the point.

- I taught Haley how to use the remote in 20 minutes.

- So think how fast you can learn it.

- What's that supposed to mean?

- See what I'm saying?

- Mitchell, it's me!

-  Hey, Dad. - Hi.

- I'm here to let you know your gaydar is broken.

- Shorty is not gay. 

- No. I, uh- I knew that.

- I made that up to mess with you for dissing Cam.

- What? That cost me 20,000 bucks.

- What do you mean? 

- I reached out to him to let him know it's okay to be gay.

- Y ou did? - Yeah.

- Right after one of the stranger golf lessons of my life.

- Turns out what he is is a lousy gambler,

- and now I'm the one on the hook for it.

- Oh, I'm so sorry.

- Then why are you smiling? 

- I'm- I'm proud of you, Dad. And you're growing. 

- Just-Just stop it. Please.

- Don't you see how hard this is for me?

- See, I used to be just like one of those guys. Now look at me.

- I got a house looks like Little Colombia.

- I got a gay son and a Chinese granddaughter.

- Vietnamese.

- Only you would know the difference.

- Don't worry, Dad. Not growing too much.

- I'm a little nervous.

-  Don't be. - I'm sure you look beautiful.

- What do you think? 

- Look at you!

- Really?

- You're gonna be fighting men off with a stick.

- I don't know about that.

-  Cameron! - Hi. Sorry for the pop over,

- but I just wanted to bring you these...

- to thank you for babysitting Lily again last night. -Oh!

- Gracias! You didn't need to do that.

-  You know I love Lily. - I know.

- Come in. Say hello.

- Cameron, this is my new friend, Whitney.

- Whitney, this is Cameron. 

- Hello. It's nice to meet you.

- That is a spectacular dress.

- This old thing?

-  What about her hair? - Oh, my gosh.

- It's like Barbra Streisand in The Way We Were.

-  One of my favorites. - Me too.

- Okay, who is reading The Forevers?

- I am.

- I am so obsessed with this whole vampire thing right now.

- Me too.

- I just met the sweetest guy named Cameron.

- I think he might be the one.

- Can people change? I don't know.

- People are who they are- give or take, yeah, 15%.

- That's how much people can change if they really want to.

-  Well, I'll see you when I see you. - Yeah, thanks for

- Haley, sweetie, wake up.

-  What? - I need you to teach me to use the TV.

- Now? Why can't Dad teach you?

- Because we're married.

- Whether it's for themselves or for the people they love

- That way. Yeah.

-  And then press- - Mmm! I got it.

- Yeah. Yeah, 15%.

-  But you know what? - I did it!

-  Sometimes that's just enough. - I did it!

- All right, I'll see you guys next week, huh?

- Jay. Jay.

- Listen, I wanna thank you for,

- you know, helping me out with that jam.

- It was nothin'. 

- No, no, no. And I got you a little present.

-  You didn't have to do that. - No, I did.

- Two tickets to see the great Michael Bubly.

- The guy sings like an angel.

- He's gonna be outside at one of the amphitheaters.

- Gloria's gonna love it.

-  No. I'm talkin' about you and me. - Oh, you and me.

-  Yeah. - Well, that's a little

- I thought maybe we could have a little picnic since it's outside.

- You know? I'll get some nice bottle of wine, a little cheese.

-  Lay on a nice blanket. All right? - Yeah, fine.

- Yo, hey. I like your hair. Who does your hair? Huh?

- Yo, handsome. Who does your hair?

S01E14 
----------------------
- Those pancakes smell great.

- What are you doing with those?

- Luke and I are doing a recycling drive.

- If we collect enough bottles

- they build a school in Africa.

- Wouldn't that be so cool

- to go to a school made out of bottles?

- That would certainly be a special school.

- Did you hear what I said, parents? 

- "Special school"?

- Okay, nobody make a big deal about it,

- but I just broke up with Dylan.

-  No  - Oh, my gosh. Are you okay, honey?

- Yeah, I'm fine. I just

- I need to date someone who has a clue,

- instead of an idiot 

- who bangs his head every time he rides his bike out of his garage

- Every time!

- I'm sorry, honey.

- I'm sorry for both of you.

- I'll have to text him later.

- Mmm. I gotta jump in the shower. I'm gonna be late.

- Where are you going?

- I'm going to meet my friend Valerie.

- I haven't seen her in 15 years.

- We used to work together.

- You worked? -Mm-hmm.

- Can't imagine you working. 

- Luke, let me tell you something.

- That is very offensive to women.

- Your mom works very hard.

- It's just now she works for us.

- I will have you know that I had quite the little career going.

- I was an account manager at Starcrest Hotels.

- I had a little cubicle,

- and-and I wore my tennis shoes to work...

- and changed into my work pumps.

- It was very Working Girl.

-  That movie's so clutch  - Mm-hmm.

- I don't mind saying I was making quite a splash.

- Well, then, why'd you quit?

- Well, Haley, call me old-fashioned,

- but I wanted to focus on raising a family.

- So I married your dad.

- Five months later, we... were...

- four months away from having this little bundle of joy.

- Mm-hmm.

- There's my lawyer.

- Gloria got into a little car accident,

- so my dad asked me to help her out.

- And, uh, this is the first

- time that my dad's asked me for legal advice,

- and it's-it's nice.

- It's nice to know that he respects me in that way.

- Well, Mitchell is an amazing lawyer. 

- My dream for him is that one day he'll be on the Supreme Court.

- Why, Cam?

- So at parties 

- I can tell everyone my partner is one of the Supremes.

- There he is-the steely, grizzled veteran...

- ready to do battle with the plucky upstart.

- Speed versus grace. 

- Brute force versus  -Let's just do this.

- Jay and I are both gym rats.

- I love the sauna. That's the dry heat.

- And the steam, wet.

- And, of course, I am just a kook for racquetball.

- Club champ two years in a row, 

- Tonganoxie, Missouri Rec Center.

- So, naturally, Jay and I have been trying for months...

- to get together to bang the old hollow rubber ball around.

- I have been avoiding this day like the plague.

- I mean, part of going to the gym is the lockerroom atmosphere.

- And if I'm there with a gay guy,

- it's-it's just not gonna be the same.

- I mean, for me, it's a locker room.

- For him, it's a showroom.

- She doesn't get it.

- *Driving in my car* 

- *I'll let you see my scar*

- What the hell? 

- Some people call me a salesman.

- I call myself a sales friend.

- So obviously, I need strangers to trust me.

- I don't take kindly to it

- when someone Tom Sellecks my bus bench.

- Phil Dunphy.

- Phil, it's Barbara.

- The Pattersons wanna back out of the deal.

- Why? What happened?

- The wife's getting cold feet.

- I told her to call you. -Okay, fine.

- I'll handle it. I'm not losing this sale.

- By the way  -I've spent way too much time on it.

- Phil, do you take Elm when you come to work? 

- I saw it, Barbara.

- It's a terrific gym, Jay.

- Very liberal with the towels. I love that.

- Showers are private, in case you wondered.

- I wasn't, but thanks for the heads-up.

- Now, that's a surprise. Boxers.

- Is that necessary?

- Well, I just always pictured you as a tighty-whitey guy.

- Well, do me a favor. The next time you picture me,

- leave the underwear out of it.

- Well, don't you worry. The only thing I'm picturing...

- is how clean the floor's gonna be when I'm done mopping it with you.

- Is that the best you can do?

- 'Cause it's gonna take a little more than some

- lame trash talk to get me out of my

- Gaah! What the hell was that?

- Our butts pressed against each other.

- They didn't press. It was glancing.

- Stop talking about it!

- Oh come on. All the time you've spent in a locker room,

- this can't be your first moon landing.

- You got a name for it? -It's very common.

- You got off easy.

- At least it didn't happen after a shower.

- Enough. -We call that a splashdown.

- That's it. I'm changing in the stall. Excuse me!

- I saw the picture, Dylan.

- You had your arm around her with that humpy look you get.

- No, that's not always how you look. We're over!

- So, I'd really like to talk to you, Mrs. Patterson,

- see if we can't turn this thing around.

- Uh, you've got my number.

- Thank you.

- I said we are over.

- Why don't you go out for a nice bike ride?

- Dylan again, huh?

- Some guys just do not know how to play it.

- Dad, what are you doing? -Oh, right.

- Just, uh, test-driving my new soup strainer.

- I dug it out of the Halloween stuff

- to see what people think.

- Do people want their real estate advice...

- from someone who leads or from someone who follows?

- I'm betting these babies are coming back in a big way.

- Buy low, sell high.

- People are gonna see this and say, "That guy's high."

- Sorry to bother you, sir.

- We're doing work next door and nicked a main,

- so we're gonna have to shut down your water.

- Oh. Okay. No problem.

- It shouldn't be too long. If you happen to need it,

- there's a porta-potty out front.

- Thanks. Hey. -Yeah.

- Nice mustache.

- Yeah, man. You too, brother.

- "You too, brother."

- Haley-She's the oldest. Fifteen.

- And then Alex is 13.

- And that's my baby, Luke. He's 11.

- Can you believe it? -Oh, my God, they're gorgeous.

- Yeah. -And things are still good with Phil the Thrill?

- Yes. Things are great. Great with him.

- I'm so happy for you. Really.

- I'm so-I'm so happy that you're happy.

- Thank you. Well, and you too.

- I mean, your life is -No, no, no-Let's talk about you.

- Okay. -Because, you know, you're

- You chose the mother. You're the mommy.

- The yummy mommy, mama, person

- You're kinda squeezing the ring right into my finger.

- Was I?

- A little. -I'm so sorry.

- And just then, it hit me. She was jealous of me.

- Yes, there'd always been a little bit of a competition between us.

- This was more serious.

- She was looking at my life as something...

- that she'd always wanted, but never had.

- So how's life in the trenches?

- You still got the bastards on the 23rd floor...

- making life miserable for all the people actually doing the work.

- Same as ever, right? -One-one difference.

- Mm-hmm? -I'm one of them bastards now.

- Wait. You're on the 23rd floor? -I'm on the 24th floor.

- Wow. That's insane. It's -It's no big deal.

- I mean, if you hadn't left, it probably would have been you.

- I was driving along this street.

- The cars were parked just like this.

- And boom, out of nowhere, he hits me.

- Okay, so, he-he cut you off? -Yes.

- Right. -A crazy driver.

- You know, I used to be a little bit like that.

- I don't know, maybe it's because of Lily,

- but I've definitely become more considerate.

- Like, I used to never let people in, and now I do.

- Just now getting that metaphor. Okay.

- So, what do you think? -Were there any witnesses?

- No, just Manny. He was in the back seat.

- Okay. -It all happened so fast--Just like they say.

- Yeah. All right. Well, this is what we're gonna do.

- I'll take a few pictures,

- and then we'll sit down and write a statement.

- Perfect. I'll go and get us a table.

- All right. -Manny, come.

- Uh, just a minute, Mom. I need to tie my shoe. -Okay.

- Mitchell. -Yeah?

- Don't talk. Listen. It was her fault.

- I'm sorry. What? -Don't look at me.

- Do something. Take pictures.

- Manny! What kind of cupcake do you want?

- Um, that's okay. I'm not hungry.

- That was a mistake. Now she'II know something's up.

- Are you okay? -I'm fine.

- She cut that guy off. She's a terrible driver.

- She's a danger to us all. -Okay, wait. Now stop.

- I thought she said he was parked and then he cut her off.

- Everybody looks parked when you're going a hundred miles an hour.

- Manny, why didn't you speak up?

- She can't take criticism about her driving.

- Once an old lady yelled at her at a crosswalk.

- She honked so long, the horn ran out.

- Manny!

- I've said too much already.

- Are you hearing this?

-  Aw, that's  - Point.

- Hinder!

- Lucky shot!

- That is game and, I believe, match.

- Yeah, fine, you won. But, you know, what do you expect?

- For the first half of the game,

- I was distracted by what happened in the locker room.

- And you're sure it's not because I'm a fabulous racquetball player?

- You're average. But I was a little thrown by you touching me.

- Which is unnatural. Not to you, of course.

- No, to you it's like rocket fuel. 

- Oh, sure. When you're gay you just walk around 

- giving butt bumps to everybody.

- It's like a high five. It's a low two.

- You know what? I'm gonna prove

- that you won only because I was distracted.

- We're gonna have a rematch right here, right now.

- So you want to go up against me again? -Yes.

- No! Damn it.

- Hello!

- Hey, Dad. Uh, did you know that the accident was Gloria's fault?

- Yes. I mean, I wasn't there, 

- but she's a horrible driver.

- If she hit 10 cars, I wouldn't be surprised.

- If you knew it was her fault, why did you get me involved?

- Because someone has to tell her she's in the wrong, 

- and better you than me.

- That's great. Here I am thinking

- that my dad actually respects me as a lawyer,

- and really you're just throwing me to the wolves.

- Can't it be both? -Okay.

- Dad, it doesn't bother you in the least...

- that your gay son is the only one

- tough enough to stand up to your wife?

- Go get 'em, Rocky. See you later.

- Your father and I had a moon landing in the locker room. 

- What's the matter with you?

- What about you? Do you ever get serious with anyone?

- Sure. Oh, no. Not yet.

- Oh, honey, you will.

- Oh, no, I hope not. It's-It's fun.

- I'm sorry. I'm just-I'm waiting for some news.

- What news? -I'm-I'm up for the Paris job.

- The-The head of the international division?

- That's-That's-That's crazy.

- Yeah, no. I mean, I'll never get it, but it'd be great...

- 'cause one of my lovers lives in Paris.

- Wow. I-I don't know what jumps out of that sentence more

- you know, "Lovers" Or "One of."

- Well, I'm single. I mean, it's kinda what you do.

- Uh-huh. -I have one in Paris.

- Um, I have Paris, New York, Miami.

- I have a fourth one.

- I'm forgetting one lover. I'm forgetting one lover. -Mmm.

- Last night I vacuumed the radiator thingy under the fridge.

- You know, it collects the dust.

- Cause you should, and I don't. So

- Oh, hey, hold on. Cross your fingers.

- I'm not gonna lie.

- The thought of Valerie getting the one job 

- in the whole company that everyone coveted

- well, I wasn't a "Lover" Of that.

- Okay. Okay, thank you.

- Well?

- Oh, they haven't made a decision.

- They're-they're gonna tell me later on.

-  That's not what they said, is it? - Uh, yeah, it is.

- Oh, Valerie, come on. It's me.

- What are friends for, 

- if not to be there for you when you get bad news?

- I got it. -Oh, my God. Aaah!

-  I'm the head of Europe. - Well, you know, for the hotel

-  Not the continent. - Kind of though. Kind of.

- Why didn't you tell me when you first heard?

- Oh, 'cause, you know

- And that's when it really hit me.

- Valerie wasn't jealous of me. She pitied me.

- And part of me wanted to take her back to the house...

- and show her everything she was missing...

- in her sad, childless, husbandless life.

- But there's a little thing called "Taking the high road."

- Why don't you come by and meet everybody?

- Oh, sure. That'd be great.

- Yeah, I mean, Alex is just a genius,

- and Haley is turning into this beautiful young woman,

- and it makes me realize that motherhood is -San Francisco.

-  The most important  - That was my fourth lover. San Francisco.

-  It would have kept me up all night. - Yeah.

- Dad, look.

- Just a sec, buddy. I'm on my way out to the bathroom.

- Check it out. The Aubreys had this huge party last night,

- and we got all these bottles to recycle.

- Great. -What's Jegermeister?

- Well, you know how in a fairy tale...

- there's always a potion that makes the princess fall asleep,

- and then the guys start kissing her?

- Well, this is like that, except you don't wake up in a castle,

- you wake up in a frat house with a bad reputation.

- Haley!

-  Luke, you're spilling it! - Aw, crud.

- God

- Gross! A rat!

- Cool.

- Hang on. I'm coming.

- I believe you have something that belongs to me.

- My heart. 

- I thought I I.M.'ed you to stay away.

- Ow! Haley.

- Hello? Dylan? D-Money?

- Hey, buddy! Hey, buddy!

- Hello, friendly neighbors!

- Little help?

- But I love you. 

- Well, you should have thought about that...

- before you took that skank Sharon Nicolini 

- to an Anne Hathaway movie.

- I didn't take her. She was just there.

- So you were just there by yourself at an Anne Hathaway movie?

- I don't think so! 

- Yeah. Yeah. I like her movies.

- She's every woman. Come on. Let's not fight.

- Let's just discuss this like two un-immature adults. 

- Hello? Mrs. Patterson.

- Hi. I've been waiting for your call.

- Yeah. Uh, is there any chance that maybe we could talk a little bit

- No, no, no, no. Now's perfect. That's fine.

- I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you. Let me just close my office door.

- There we go. Much, much better.

- Okay. Maybe, uh, we should go over the accident one more time.

- Put the dogs on a row. You're such a good lawyer.

- Uh, I just wanna make sure

- we're 100% clear on exactly what happened.

- Oh, we're clear. I told you.

- What? You don't believe me?

- No, no. I just

- You know, sometimes you can forget tiny details.

- Like, is it possible, maybe, uh, you were driving too fast?

- Who said I was driving fast? -Yeah, who?

- I just-I'm looking at the street,

- and I'm thinking if you were driving a little fast,

- it's possible that maybe you

-  didn't see the car - You're like everyone else, huh?

- You blame the Latino driver. 

- Where I come from, they always blame the Latino driver.

- Where you come from, isn't everybody a Latino driver?

-  Manny, tell him. - I can't 'cause I have a cupcake in my mouth.

- Oh, come on. Don't blame your cupcake.

- What? You think I'm guilty too?

-  No. - Fine.

- I don't need you as a lawyer anymore.

- And if you two think I'm such a bad driver,

- you're safer walking home.

- Chao.

-  Here it is. - It's really cute.

- Yeah. We're pretty proud of it.

- Here's your stupid CDs...

- and your clothes and your poems!

-  Don't you do it! - Oh, I'm doing it.

- Haley, stop it. What are you doing? 

- Tearing out my heart.

- Oh, why don't you go get a hickey from Sharon Nicolini?

- It's from my guitar strap, Haley.

- Oh, thanks for reminding me. -That's my daughter Haley

- And her boyfriend, Dylan, um

- This is a nice color. 

- Yeah. Um, listen. This is not normal,

- with all that, nor-nor is that liquor smell.

- Phil, honey? Oh, my God. Luke, what is that?

- Jegermeister. Dad says it makes girls easier to kiss.

-  What happened to the rug? - I had an accident.

- Okay. Alex, what are you doing? 

- I'm trying to kill a rat.

- Okay

- Sharon was helping me buy you a birthday present.

- Don't you get it? I love your ass.

- I-You know, I-I-I'm late and I should go.

- I know. I know. -Yeah.

- And it seems like things have gotten a little wonky around here.

- I don't know where Phil is. He's definitely

- Oh, my God. Alex

- Where's your father? 

- He went outside to go to the bathroom.

- It's... not usually like this. Oh, gross.

-  Let's just get married. - Okay.

- You will not regret this decision, Mrs. Patterson.

- And I'll tell you what. 

- We're gonna have you over to our little house to celebrate.

-  Okay? Okay, bye-bye. - You should come back again

-  sometime, when you get a break - Claire! Claire!

- Phil, what are you-what are you doing?

- Just concluding a little business.

- Very successfully, I might add.

-  Honey - Hey!

-  Hi. - Is that Valerie?

-  Yeah. - Wow!

-  You look fantastic. - Thank you.

- Come here. Get over here.

- Okay.

-  How long has it been? - A long time.

- Oh, my goodness. 

-  Oh, I can't touch you. Okay. - A little bit difficult. 

- Gulf divides us, eh?

-  So nice to see you. - It's great to see you though

-  Okay. - All right.

-  Okay, then. - Thanks for coming by.

-  It's such a pleasure. - Bye-bye.

-  Thanks for stopping by. - You have a beautiful family.

-  She looks great, doesn't she? - What is on your face?

- One time! Once!

- One time I bring somebody home...

- who I want to impress, and what do I find?

- A bunch of booze-drenched hill people...

- just sitting around in their underwear and-and chasing rats...

- and fornicating in the stairwell.

-  Can I say something? - No. No, you can't, Mario.

- There is nothing left to say but thank you.

- Thank you all.

- I told you I'd win.

- Not talking so much now, are you, hotshot?

- Hope you enjoy that nice, hot shower,

- but it's not gonna wash away the shame of that 15-7 beatdown.

- You should have seen the look on your face...

- when that drop shot just kissed the wall.

- Ah. Okay, splashdown.

- Got me again. Yep.

- Make the uptight straight guy all embarrassed.

- Except for one thing -doesn't even bother me anymore.

- I could do this all day. Here, another one for you.

- Maybe a couple of 'em.

- Jay, I just noticed a sauna back here.

- How big of a hurry are we in? -Biggest hurry of your life.

- 'Scuse me. 'Scuse me.

- Well, if you're going to be stranded,

- might as well be in a place full of cupcakes.

- I don't think you need any more.

- Ay. I'm sorry, guys.

- It's true. I am a defensive driver.

- You mean you're defensive about -I know what I am.

- Let's go.

- It's just that I don't like when people just assume 

- that I'm a bad driver.

- Maybe it was just, like, a little bit my fault.

- Well, I'm glad you can admit that, Gloria.

- But I'm still gonna need you as my lawyer, Mitch.

- Why?  -Because this one

- It was not my fault, I promise you.

- That's what that sound was. 

- It was the big cupcake.

- That was unreal. Mom was crazy.

- I'm scared.

- Look. I know your mom pretty well. She's fine.

- I'd be willing to bet she's just composing herself,

- taking a nice, long, peaceful walk in the park.

- Perfect.

- At that moment all I wanted was to be with my family.

- But of course, that meant finding a way to apologize...

- to the people that I had belittled and rejected.

- Okay, you are so crazy. That song totally rules.

- Daddy, you're crazy. -Crazy right.

- Hey, honey. -Hi.

- Hey, Mom. Come on. Sit down.

- No, seriously, Dad. It's lame. 

- Seriously, Luke. It's not.

- You got some mustard or something on your face.

- I think I know a little bit about music.

- I was a DJ in college.

- I had my own show in the coveted time slot.

- Daybreak with Dunphy. -Are you kidding me?

- No, I'm not kidding you. And I played Rick Astley.

- Dad, that's embarrassing. -Never gonna give, Sing it, Luke.

- They could have been petty.

- They really could have made me pay, but they didn't.

- Never loved 'em more.

- Why the hell couldn't Valerie have seen them like that?

- Hey, Dylan.

- Hey, Mr. Dunphy. 

- What's happening?

- Well, Haley and I got into another fight.

- Oh. Say Anything.

- Um, good morning?

- No. Say Anything. -Newspaper.

- No, Dylan. Say Anything. Clutch movie.

- Clutch movie.

- She probably won't be up for a couple hours still.

- It's okay. It's not that heavy.

S01E15 
----------------------
- Happy Valentine's Day.

- Oh, happy Valentine's Day.

- So, Fratelli's tonight? 

- Hello, cannoli canoe.

- I like it. Nice fit.

- Swanky material.

- Jay, you look so strong and sexy.

- Like an Olympic wrestler, but with money.

-  Your turn. - Okay.

- This is my favorite day in America.

- Happy Valentine's Day, gorgeous.

- They're huge!

-  Oh, my God. - Yeah, those will work.

-  Beautiful. - You can wear 'em tonight.

- I have a surprise.

- Don't tell me you're finally taking me salsa dancing!

- And who's David Brenner? 

- Only a Vegas legend.

- Is he a magician? 'Cause I love magicians.

- He's a comedian. 

- A comedian? It's Valentine's Day.

- I thought we were going salsa dancing, not to watch a comedian.

- You're gonna love him. Trust me.

- The guy's hilarious. 

- Okay, tell me one of his jokes.

- He doesn't do jokes.

-  Does he have a mallet? -No.

- So then how does he get hit in the head?

- He doesn't get hit in the head.

- He- He makes observations.

- He tells the truth in a funny way.

- Come on. He's been on Johnny Carson a hundred times.

- Who the hell is Johnny Carson? 

- Oh, for God's sake.

- Gloria and I are from different generations.

- And I won't lie- It isn't always easy.

- I mean, last week she thought 

- Simon and Garfunkel were my lawyers.

- No I didn't. 

- It was a joke.

- I don't get it. 

- Maybe that's because there's no mallet.

- Yeah, I wish I had a mallet right now.

- ...was to stay in Northern California.

- Did you indicate to her how long that you were gonna take?

-  Happy Valentine's Day. - Happy Valentine's Day.

-  Happy Valentine's Day, Daddy. - Happy Valentine's Day, Lily.

- Notice anything different?

-  Oh, that is cute. - Cute?

- We spent a lot of time on this.

- I don't see how. 

- You just cut up one of your boas.

- Uh- Actually, no. We repurposed it.

- It was sort of a Bob Mackie meets Martha Stewart project.

- Okay. Well, we just thought it would be a nice surprise.

- It's hardly a surprise. I mean,

- you dress her up for every holiday.

- I was giving her a bath last night,

- and I still saw traces of Martin Luther King behind her ear.

- All right. Not in the spirit. We get it. 

- No, I'm-I'm sorry.

- No. It's adorable. I just

- I'm really nervous about my closing argument.

- Oh, you've been rehearsing for weeks. 

- You're gonna be great.

- Let's hope so. 

- Hey, and I was wondering

- since you're gonna be in court all day- 

- You can open the chocolates.

- Score.

- Hi, Dylan. 

- Happy Valentine's Day, Mrs. Dunphy.

- Oh. Dylan, thank you. That is so sweet.

- You know, all women should look as tasty as you when they're old.

- Huh. Conflicted.

- Hey, baby.

- Hey. Take this sweet gift as a token of my affection,

- my unending love and admiration

- Oh, my God. Yay, it's big!

- Oh, my God.

- I love it. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

- Seriously, you gotta put a black light on it. 

- It'll blow your mind.

- Wow! Dylan, I didn't know you could paint. 

- Oh, I didn't. I just took a photo 

- and I put it through this program 

- that turns it into a painting.

- So you two actually did...

-  that. - Uh-huh.

- Yeah.

- Let's go put this over my bed.

- Not- No, no.

- You don't need to be in the bedroom at all.

- I'll take it.

- Did he trump me? D-Money.

- You tell me. He made a painting out of a photograph one time.

- I have hand-picked a card,

- drawn a heart in the steam on the medicine cabinet,

- and taken Claire to Fratelli's,

- a family-style Italian restaurant,

- for 17 years in a row.

- Yeah, he got me. He got me.

-  Bye, honey. - See you later.

- See you later. 

- Phil, what is that?

- You know, we don't have to go to Fratelli's tonight.

- Okay, what do you have in mind?

- Well, I thought you might enjoy a night at a hotel.

- I would, but would you and the kids be okay?

-  I meant together. - Yes, I know.

- Oh. I know. I know. I got it.

- So, what do you think?

- I think you're not getting any sleep tonight,

- so you might want to take a nap at work today.

- I always do.

- Phil? Sweetie.

- As long as we're talking about being a little bit naughty,

- what would you say to a little role-playing?

-  Role-play? - Mm-hmm.

- I'm in. 

- I'll set up sleepovers for the kids.

- And I'll swing by after work to pick you up. 

- No, no. Why don't you meet me in the hotel bar 

- and see if you can pick me up there.

- Careful, lady. You're gonna wake up a sexy sleeping giant.

- Perhaps I'll be Reginald Appleby,

- an English gentleman in town for a polo match.

- Phil.

- Or...Honorable businessman from Hong Kong.

- Kinda wrecking it.

- It's not a big deal, Claire.

- I just train tigers for a living.

- Too... No?

- Are these rose petals? 

- Yes, to commemorate our love.

- I had to settle. 

- Well, your mom might think so,

- but a lot of people think I'm a catch. 

- No. The case. I- I was this close to nailing it,

- and then my client gets scared and settles. 

- I'm sorry. Maybe you'd like a chocolate.

- Notice that I have not eaten any of the chocolates.

- There were two levels. You know it and I know it.

- This is so frustrating.

- I had one of the greatest closing arguments of all time

- all about the big government rolling over the little guy,

- and I even had this great moment at the end...

- where I would point to the state seal and I'd say, "Shame!"

- Oh, that's what you were doing in the shower.

- I was a little worried.

- Um, that's Manny. 

- I said we would watch him tonight. I hope you don't mind.

- I didn't know you were gonna be going through all this.

- No, it's fine. It might be nice to have him around.

- He always make me laugh. 

- Hi, Manny.

- The universe is cold and loveless.

- Uh-oh. Bad Valentine's Day?

- I went for the gold- Fiona Gunderson.

- I poured my heart and soul into a poem, left it on her desk.

- I even burned the edges to make it look fancy.

- And she didn't like it? 

- Oh, she loved it.

- But this kid Durkas told her he wrote it.

- Well, Manny, why-why didn't you just tell her the truth?

- She was already gone.

- And she's on a date with him at my favorite restaurant, 

- Great Shakes.

- How do you know all this? 

- I invited her in the poem.

- Right after the line of,

- "My love is deeper than the Great Lakes."

- Okay, well, this is unacceptable. 

- Oh, boy. Here we go.

- No, it's not that big of a deal. 

- This is what we're gonna do.

- We're gonna shoot over to Great Shakes, get a table.

- Manny can reclaim the love of his life.

- You and I can get a couple Mudslides.

- I don't know.

- Durkas is gonna be there. 

- I've seen the kid do a pull-up.

- Hey, Manny, it's Valentine's Day.

- It's not the day you run away from love.

- It's the day you track it down, tie it up and take it home.

- Now, if we can pull this off,

- you and your little lady friend will be belly up to a ice cream counter

- having a milk shake with two straws.

- What do you say?

- I like it.

- Thank you. Thank you.

- Scientists- They don't know why this is true,

- but it's true.

- Women with big rear ends live longer.

- Man who tell 'em that don't.

- Did you read about this man,

- a 91 -year old bank robber in Texas?

- He goes into a bank

- "The hell did I want?"

- They had over 4,000 photos of him escaping from the bank.

- See? He's funny, huh?

- Mind if I join you?

- I'm Clive. Clive Bixby.

- Yes, I can see that. I'm Juliana.

- So, Clive, you in town for a convention,

- or do you just forget your name a lot?

- Pretty kitty has nails.

- I like that.

- I'm in town for a trade show.

- I design high-end electroacoustic transducers.

- Wow, that is very...

- specific.

- It's a fancy way of saying I get things to make noise.

- So, what's your story?

- Miss America Pageant in town?

- You're a pretty smooth talker, Clive.

- I'm pretty smooth all over.

- Sir, there's no smoking in here.

- Oh, that's fine. I'm not actually a smoker.

- You're quite the Boy Scout, Clive.

- Tell me, would you be interested in 

- earning a merit badge tonight?

- Do you know anything about tying knots?

- I probably shouldn't be talking to you.

- I'm a married man.

- Well, I just so happen to like married men.

- Tell me about your wife. 

- Well, she's beautiful, of course.

- Really? Well, if she's so very beautiful,

- why are you here with me?

- Because she's always so tired...

- and she's always making lists of things for me to do.

- Maybe if you did them she wouldn't be so tired. 

- Oh no. She can make list for days.

- But back to your mouth and how sexy it is.

- Mm-mmm. I wanna go back to these alleged lists 

- and your nagging wife.

- I'm not talking about you.

- I didn't mean that. Can we try this again?

- Yeah.

- So if your wife is so beautiful,

- why are you here with me?

- Because...

- I respect her too much...

- to do to her...

- what I'm going to do to you?

- Oh, jackpot.

- I'll be right back, Clive.

- Do you have eyes on her? Is she here?

- Two o'clock- blonde at the back table.

- Yep. I have a visual.

- Let's not talk like that anymore. Over.

- Okay, this is it. I'm off to win the heart of my beloved.

- Well, this is nice.

- I mean, if we can't have our own Valentine's Day,

- it's nice that we can give somebody else one.

- All right, Cam. I'm sorry.

- I'm sor- I'm sorry I have not been attentive.

- I've been spending the last five months...

- pouring my core beliefs 

- into the greatest speech that I will ever write,

- and then that moment gets taken away.

- Hey, buddy. How'd it go?

- I can't do it, not while Durkas is there.

- He has the natural confidence. I admire it and fear it.

- We will deal with him directly. We need a plan.

- Could you be more dramatic?

- We need a plan.

- In Oregon,

- the state legislature ratified a, uh, bill...

- that from now on 

- it is a crime to have sex in Oregon with a farm animal.

- How ugly are the women in Oregon?

- He's funny, Jay. 

- I know. See?

-  I can tell you're not- you're not from Oregon. -No.

-  You are gorgeous. - Thank you.

- Thank you for bringing your father to the show.

- Oh, no. I'm her husband, Dave.

-  No kidding. - Yeah.

- What's it like to be married to someone 

- who was there when the Bible was written?

- What was it called then? Just "The Testament"?

- That's, uh- That's- That's good stuff.

- Oh, now he's trying to turn out the light.

- Phone call. Over there.

-  Hello? - Uh, yes. Hello.

-  Mr. Durkas? - Yeah.

- This is Don Jolly...

- with the Great Shakes corporate office,

- and I have good news for you.

- You have been selected to take part in a random survey...

- that you could win cash and prizes.

- Does that sound like something you'd be interested in?

- Yeah, sure. 

- Okay, just a few simple questions for you.

- Would you please rank your favorite ice creams 

- at Great Shakes from least favorite to favorite?

- I don't know 'em by heart.

- There should be a menu right there to your right.

- To your right. Mm-hmm. There you go.

- Oh. Hi, Manny. 

- Hi, Fiona. Can I join you?

-  I guess so. -Thanks.

- And you don't have to worry about him cheating. That's for sure.

- Because if he does, you'll catch him...

- when he comes home with two sets of teeth in his mouth.

- Yeah.

- So tell me, on the wedding night, what-what did he do?

- Did he say he wanted to change into something comfortable 

- and go into a coma? 

-  Listen, I gotta use the men's room. - Nuh-uh. 

- I gotta use the men's room. I'll be right back.

- Where you going? Wait a minute.

- I'm only joking. That's what I do.

- You know, you're way younger than I am.

- You just don't look it.

- Clive, I have a little something for you.

- What is it?

- My dress.

-  My bra. - Oh, my g

- My underwear.

-  My God. - Yeah.

- What do you say we take this upstairs?

- This is so much better than cheesy garlic bread.

-  Chocolate. - Uh-huh. Go on.

-  Vanilla. - I'm taking copious notes.

- Keep goin', Mr. Durkas.

- So, why would Ted say he wrote the poem if he didn't?

- Maybe because you're the cutest girl in school,

- and you have a laugh that makes science lab seem like recess.

- Would you be more or less inclined 

- to visit a Great Shakes establishment...

- if you knew your satisfaction was guaranteed?

-  That's a dumb question. - Excuse me.

- It is not a dumb question, Mr. 

-  Tarnation! He hung up. - Then you can drop the accent.

- Delgado. What are you doing here?

- Discussing poetry. Maybe you'll like to recite some of yours.

- I'm not gonna recite anything.

- Just admit you didn't write the poem.

- I don't know what he's talking about.

- Get out of here before you get your butt kicked.

-  I'm going over there. - No, I got this.

- Whoa! Whoa, sir! Sir? Turn around.

- Sir, you have no right

- to claim ownership of another person's work.

- Who are you? 

- I'm a lawyer.

- You have a lawyer?

- It is one thing to lie,

- but then to bully this young man- it's unforgivable.

- And this is what's wrong with the world today.

- The big guy...

- thinks that he can roll right over the little guy...

- until the little guy says, "Enough."

- And that's what this little guy's doing

- right here, right now.

- Can we stop calling me "Little guy"? I'm in the 40th percentile.

- Shh. I got this.

- Ted Durkas clearly did not write that poem.

- I know it. He knows it.

- Deep down in your heart, Fiona

- You know it too.

- Shame!

- Fine! Whatever. I stole his stupid poem.

-  You did? - I told you.

- There you go.

- I only did it because I had the feelings,

- I just didn't know how to show 'em.

- Really? That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever done for me.

- You've gotta be kidding me.

-  Let's get out of here. This chick's crazy. - Seriously.

- I've never seen you like that.

- You have no idea how good that felt.

- Well, happy Valentine's Day, counselor.

- This is all happening so fast, Juliana.

- I know, and I have to be home to my husband by midnight.

- Ooh, a twist.

- Phil! Phil, my coat is stuck.

-  Who's Phil? - No, not now! Seriously.

-  My coat is stuck. - Oh, oh. Honey, take off your coat!

-  Are you kidding me? Pull it. - Oh, my goodness.

- Pull it. Come on. Come on.

- Oh, boy. Not good. Not good.

- Okay. Okay. Okay.

- Come on up. Treat 'em like they're regular stairs.

-  It's okay. - Come on through.

- Happy Valentine's Day. You look lovely.

-  So do you. Not in a weird way. - Yeah.

-  How are you? Hi. - Hi.

-  Happy Valentine's- - Let me just get in here. 

- Let me get in here.

-  Okay? - Phil?

-  Hey, Tom. - Hi.

- How are you? Honey

- Claire, you remember Tom Mickleson from the office

-  and his wife, Susan. - I do. Hey.

- Is your coat stuck?

- It is. It really is. It's in there pretty darn good.

- Why don't you take it off? 

- Um, I'm freezing cold.

- At least let me give it a shot.

-  Oh, I don't think... - No, no, no. I got it.

-  Mr. And Mrs. Dunphy? - Hey.

-  Principal Balaban. - Hey, how are you?

- Who's Clive Bixby?

- Oh, uh, he makes speakers.

-  He's actually in town for a trade show. - Phil.

- My, are you stuck? 

- Yeah, I am. A little bit.

- Why don't you take off that coat? 

- Um, I'm chilly.

- It's really jammed in here.

-  Let me in there. I'll get you. - No, I think we're okay.

- Mrs. Dunphy?

- Are you kidding me?

- Hi! Luke's math teacher, Ms. Passwater.

- "Passwater."

- Ah, Jay, papi, don't pay attention to what he's saying.

- He's just being funny. 

- Because he points out the truth.

- Those people were laughing because they saw it too.

-  What do you care what they think? - I don't.

- I care what you think.

- I love you. You're my valentine. 

- Yeah, for now.

- But what about when I'm 80 

- and I'm in a wheelchair, on oxygen?

- You still gonna want me?

- Do you think I'm so shallow

- that I'm gonna leave you when you're old?

- What if I gain a hundred pounds? You gonna leave me then?

-  No. - What's with the pause?

- Well, it's not exactly fair. 

- I mean, I have to get old. You don't have to get fat. 

- If I want to get fat, I get fat.

- Okay, fine. And if you do, 

- I'll be there. You'll see.

- Yeah, watch me. Watch me, how I get fat.

-  I can get fat. - And I'll be there.

- Good.

-  You wanna go back in? - No.

- I got a better idea.

- Let's go salsa dancing. This guy's not that funny.

- Perfect.

- We're good! We're good! I talked to Maintenance.

- They're- They're- They're coming, so go on ahead.

- See you guys. See you later.

- See you in school. Good to see you guys.

- Maintenance is gonna take care of it.

-  So we're fine. - Okay. Okay, how long till they get here?

- I was faking it. No one's coming for us.

- Well, then, go and get them! Hurry!

- That was the most embarrassing moment of my life.

- Claire! Phil!

- Stand by.

- What, did you get your belt stuck? 

- I did. Yeah.

- Take your coat off. Here, let me help you.

-  No, no, Dad. Dad, I'm fine. - Come on!

- What are you, naked under there?

-  Aw, geez. - It's okay.

-  I got this. - Okay.

-  Claire, follow my lead. - Okay.

- Okay.

-  Wow. - Okay.

-  Thank you. - It has happened to me before.

- That was impressive.

- Take it down a notch, Clive.

-  You okay? - Yeah. I'm good.

-  All right. - I'm good.

-  Happy Valentine's Day. - Happy Valentine's Day.

-  Chao. - Okay. See ya.

- Bye. Good night.

- Oh. That's

- Sorry. See you, guys.

- Hi, honey.

- Hey, I just wanted to tell you how great you were last night.

-  Uh, Phil... - Sorry I got the, uh- the oil everywhere, but, hey"

-  Uh, sweetie. - They're not our sheets, right?

- Honey- Honey, remember when the salesman told us...

- that the Sienna was built with the whole family in mind?

- Yeah. Well, the whole family just heard that.

- Uh- Uh- Guess

- I guess the Bluetooth works.

-  Mmm. - Why did you have oil?

- Because, buddy, we were making French fries.

- In your room?

- Why don't you guys just pop in a DVD?

S01E16 
----------------------
- What am I most afraid of? Hmm. Let's see.

- Global warming... and getting a "B."

- The phone ringing in the middle of the night.

- That I'm too much of a perfectionist.

- Honey, this isn't a job interview.

- Oh, man.

- Job interviews.

-  Nothing. - Yeah, right. What about the pigeons?

- Oh, I don't like them. They're shifty.

-  Losing Mitchell. - Oh!

-  Hotel bedspreads. - Ooh.

- Never getting my driver's license.

- Or getting one and the picture sucks.

- Dying alone.

- Oh, Haley, sweetie, did you find your shoes?

- Mom, please, not today.

- I just wanted to know if you found your shoes.

- Why are you hounding me? I'm freaking out right now.

- You need to relax. It's just a driver's test.

- It's my third driver's test, and if I fail again,

- I have to wait six months to retake it.

- That's six more months of you driving me everywhere.

- Then I'm, like, "There's no way I'm wearing that."

-  And she was, like. "Well, if you don't wear it, -Like

- then you can't play."

-  And then I was, like, "That's fine by me." - Honey, like.

-  And then she was, like, "Well, if you don't play" - Like! Like!

-  Mom! -Stop! Stop saying "Like" All the time.

-  You're embarrassing me! - Stop it! Like, like, like, like, aah!

- Haley. Found your jacket.

- Why is everyone on me? God!

-  Ignore her. - She can't focus on two things at once.

- Always a good quality in a driver.

- Sweetie, we need to get you some shoes for the dance tonight.

- No, we don't. I'm not going. 

- What are you talking about?

- Why would you not be going to the dance?

- Because school dances are lame.

- A bunch of immature boys

- trying to impress you with how cool they are...

- when they're really just a bunch of dorks.

- Ready to go down under, mate?

- Yes.

- What are you doing? 

- Treasure hunting.

- A few days ago, the cable guy was under the house.

- When he was leaving, he said to Haley,

- "Wow. That's quite a collection you've got down there."

- Here's the thing. We have no idea what he's talking about.

- All week, Luke and I have been getting more and more 

- excited about what it could be.

- I bet it's really cool old magazines.

- Yeah. Or a bunch of necklaces made out of animal teeth.

- Or bugs frozen in amber.

- What if it's really expensive bottles of wine?

- Or a suit of armor.

- What if there's ancient Indian arrowheads under there?

-  What if it's gold bars? - Oh, you think?

- For God sakes, why don't you go under the house and look?

- Hey, Cam. Cam, where did we get this dolly from?

- From Janice and Olivia.

- They brought it over yesterday. Lily loves it.

- Seems a little frilly, you know, coming from them.

- What, because they're lesbians?

- That's sort of an offense stereotype, don't you think?

- Yeah, I suppose. I'm sorry. 

- Oh, hey, did they bring back our coffee maker?

- No. It was too big. They were on their motorcycle.

- We got off to an awkward start with our pediatrician,

- a very nice Asian lady

-  Irrelevant. - Named Dr. Miura.

- So I took the bold step of inviting her over for brunch.

- I'm sorry. Uh, bold?

- She said no patient had ever done it before.

- Yeah. Subtext, "This is weird."

- I didn't hear any subtext.

- Do you hear any now?

- I don't even know why we're doing this.

- Because what if Lily gets sick 

- and there's a Tamiflu shortage?

- Who do you think's gonna get that medicine?

- The patient she likes, that's who.

- Well, maybe if you bake her a cake, 

- she'll give us free X-rays.

- It's all about making connections.

- Why do you think the dentist gives me all that free stuff?

- Um, because he's a huge queen and he has a big crush on you.

- Really? Do you think so?

-  Mom? - Hmm?

- I have a fever. 

- Ay, mi amor. Come here and I feel you.

- Ooh. I don't wanna get you sick. It could be fatal.

- Then by all means, stand next to me.

- Let me feel you.

- Ay, papi, but you're not warm.

- Uh, probably because you were cooking and your hands are warm.

- I better skip the party tomorrow just to be safe.

- Oh. Yeah, the party.

-  What? - The party.

- I understand about 20% of what goes on around here.

- The party is at an amusement park,

-  and Manny's afraid of roller coasters. - Poor kid.

- I don't know where he gets his fear from...

- because his father's not afraid of anything.

- No bulls, no heights, 

- no helicopters, no fast cars

- But go to dinner with him and wait for the check to come.

- Then you'll see fear in his eyes.

- Like the waiter's a ghost.

-  Excited? - Yeah.

- We're like Ponce de Leon and his son, Little Ponce.

- Who's that? - Famous treasure hunters.

- His name was Ponce? He'd get made fun of at my school.

- They'd probably call him "Pants."

- Pants.

- Or maybe, um, "Fancy Ponce."

- That's a good one.

- All right.

- Let's do this.

-  You okay, Dad? - Yeah. Yeah, I am.

- Yep. Gonna take a little more 

- than getting trapped in a small, dark space with a wild animal 

-  to rattle your old man. - All right.

- You never want your kids to see you scared.

- You wanna be that rock

- that they can grab ahold of in a stormy sea.

- Actually, a rock would sink. So a floating rock.

- Let's start over. It's windy, and you've got a lot of papers.

- Okay. Let's do this, buddy.

- Okay! Good recon.

- Got the lay of the land, so

- Aren't we going in? 

- Yep, we are.

- But won't it be fun if we did it with ski goggles and barbecue tools?

-  I guess. - Yeah.

-  Yeah. Let's do that. - All right.

- Can I just say that is a lovely outfit.

- Oh. Thank you.

- Well, it's just nice to see you out of your lab coat.

- You actually have quite a nice figure.

- Take it down a notch. 

- We're trying to make a friend, not initiate a three-way.

- Lily looks great. 

- Do you think so?

- Shouldn't she have more teeth?

- I see these kids running around at the park,

- and they look like sharks.

- Don't worry. She's perfect. Aren't you, Lily? 

- Oh, look how calm she is with you.

- She's usually very fidgety around new people.

- Well, I just think she senses 

- you're gonna be a good friend for her...

- during good times and- and flu season.

- Mommy.

- Did she just

- Did she just say

- Well, her first word...

- was every gay father's worst nightmare.

-  "Mommy." - Oh.

- Jay, he won't admit it,

- but I know that Manny's sad because he's missing the party.

- Why don't we take him somewhere to take his mind off it, hmm?

- I could have guessed he'd have trouble with roller coasters.

- That kid gets woozy at barbershops

- when they spin his chair towards the mirror.

- How about we take him to the pier and go fishing, huh? Manny!

-  He likes to fish? - Yeah.

- He comes from a long line of fishermen and smugglers. 

- But I encourage the fishing.

- Manny, you like to fish? 

- Fishing? Yeah.

- You want to go to the pier today?

-  Is this a trick to see if I'm really sick? - No.

- Maybe the fresh air will make you feel better.

- Well, then yeah, 'cause there's no place 

-  where I'm more at one with  - just get your coat.

-  Are you nervous? - Shut up, Alex.

- I was just asking. I'd be nervous if I were you.

- Alex, leave your sister alone. She's gonna be fine.

- As long as I don't get the same guy. He's so mean.

-  You probably will. - You won't.

-  He hates me. -He doesn't hate you.

-  He yelled at me. - You drove into the bushes.

- Oh, no. It's him. Please don't be for me. Please don't be for me.

- Please don't be for me. Please don't be me. Hi.

- Oh, thank God.

- Well, come on. I don't have all day.

- I'm gonna throw up. 

- Okay, no. This is what you're gonna do.

- You're gonna get in that car, put on your seat belt...

- and take three deep breaths and relax.

- This guy sees hundreds of kids every day.

-  He probably doesn't even remember you, all right? - Okay.

- Yo. Let's move it, two strikes.

- That's more than three breaths, honey.

- See how much better this is?

- The truck goes in. It gets video.

- And then we get a preview of whatever's in there. 

- How ingenious is that, huh?

- Are you just scared to go in?

- Why would you say that?

- Well, when you stuck your head in, you screamed a little.

- I told you. That was the house settling.

- Besides, this is so much cooler. This is how NASA does it.

- Now, hand me the ltty Bitty Book Light.

- Yeah. Final piece of the puzzle.

- Blast off.

-  Hey, Dad?  - Yeah?

- How are you supposed to steer if you don't know where you're going?

- Stay in the present, buddy. Gotta do it by feel.

- Gotta get all Jedi on it.

-  Did you just lose my truck? - No.

-  You just lost my truck! - No, I didn't!

- That was my truck! Grandpa just gave it to me!

-  I told you to stay in the present! - Stop yelling!

-  Truce? - Yeah. Sorry.

- This is delicious.

- Oh. Thank you. 

- The recipe's from the now-defunct Gourmet magazine.

- Why do all the things I love go away?

- Look, I don't even think she said the "M" Word.

- No, we heard it. It was clear as day.

- I- I just don't know what we've done wrong.

- I quit my job so I could stay at home with her.

- But maybe it's not enough.

- Maybe we're not providing her 

- with the feminine energy that she needs.

- Yeah, I wouldn't be too concerned about that.

- You- You know it's because you're Asian, right?

-  Cam. - No, I'm sorry. What?

- Am I just supposed to ignore the giant panda in the room?

- Pandas are from China. I- Well, it doesn't matter.

- Okay, okay. I think what my hysterical partner 

- is just trying to say, if I may,

- that for the first six months of her life,

- Lily was raised by very loving Asian women, in an orphanage,

- with whom she clearly bonded.

- And then suddenly you come in with all of your Asian-ness...

- and-and-and breasts and womb, lady bits

- and it all just comes rushing back to her, and I

- You guys are overreacting.

- I'm sure Lily just strung a couple of random syllables together,

- and they happen to sound something like that word.

- But that's all.

-  Do you really think that? - Of course.

- She's right. She's right. 

- We're being ridiculous.

- We're being ridiculous. 

- Your daddies are being ridiculous.

- Mommy.

- Okay. Well

-  Mr. Tucker  - No, no, no.

- She's made her choice! She's made her choice.

-  All right, left turn. - Here?

-  At the intersection, yeah. - Okay.

- Left.

-  What? - I said left. You're going right.

- Wait. No, wait. I'm trying, okay? 

- Pull over.

-  No, I can do this! - Pull over now.

- Why are you crying? 

- Why do you hate me?

- Oh, hell. Haley, I don't hate you.

- You seem like a nice girl. You remind me of my daughter.

- Which is why I want you to live a long and happy life...

- and be safe and not hurt my daughter.

- I really want my license.

- I've been practicing a lot, I swear.

-  You gonna drink and drive? - No, sir.

-  You gonna text and drive? - No, sir.

- All right. Let's start this from the beginning.

- Could you smile first?

- I'll be less nervous if you smile.

- Okay, that didn't help.

- Just go.

- Today feels like a good day for halibut.

- Hey, Jay, did I ever tell you about the time...

- I used peanut butter and jelly for bait 

- and I caught a thresher shark?

- I don't know. You tell me a lot of funny things.

- Why are we going this way?

- It's just another way to go.

- Uh-oh. Something's going on.

- What are you talking about? 

- Wake up, old man.

- She's trying to get me on that roller coaster.

-  No, she's not. - Yes, I am.

-  What? - Told you.

- Manny, you have to face your fears.

- That's why we're here?

- Why didn't you let me in on your little plan?

- Because you're the worst liar.

- He would have seen right through you.

- I don't wanna go on the roller coaster.

- Manny, you were afraid to light the barbecue,

- but now your eyebrows have grown back...

- and your salmon is legendary.

-  What if I fall out? - I will catch you.

- That's not possible. He would crush you.

- What if I throw up?

- I will clean it up. It wouldn't be the first time.

- Geez, these are new shoes.

- You're not gonna let up, are you?

- Baby, I think you know the answer.

- Fine. Let's get it over with.

- That's my boy. Vamos, Jay.

- No, I'm not going on that. That's bad for my back.

-  Your back is fine. - I got an inner-ear thing.

-  Oh, please. Don't tell me you're scared too. - Scared?

- What is this "Scared" Stuff from?

- What am I, a child? I'm not scared.

- You see? You're the worst liar.

- Well, if he's not going, I'm not going.

- Oh, for God's sake, fine! I'll go alone.

- Here. Take my girlie purse 

- and you my floppy hat,

- and if you need it, there's the ladies' room.

- I'm not man enough to fight this.

- Here. Hold my purse.

- Oh, hell!

-  What's taking them so long? - I don't know.

- The only reason I'm not panicking is I haven't seen a giant geyser.

- You know, honey, I think I know why you don't wanna go tonight.

-  Because school dances are lame? - No.

-  'Cause you don't know how to dance. - That's not it.

- I can help you with that. Come on. 

-  Come on. - Oh, God, no. No, Mom.

- Oh, yeah. Back in the day, I was quite the dancer.

- Oh, my God. You and Dad together suddenly makes so much sense.

- Mom. Mom, stop. Stop.

- Please, stop. I know how to dance.

- I just don't wanna be part of that freak show.

- Sweetheart, you're a beautiful girl.

- Someone will ask you to dance.

- I know that. It's just stupid.

- Somebody will ask you. 

- Why do you keep saying that?

- Somebody will ask you.

- But what if they don't?

- Honey, if they don't,

- then you do the exact same thing I told your sister, okay?

- Take three deep breaths and relax.

- Even the advice I get is a hand-me-down.

- Mom, I did it! I passed!

- Oh, my God!

-  I got my license! - Congratulations!

- I have my license! I got my license!

-  Car's not in "Park." - Oh. Oops.

- You better run to that counter.

-  Go. Right now. - Run! Run!

- Still can't believe you lost my truck.

- It's gone, buddy. Let it go.

- You know, maybe it's better we don't solve this little mystery.

- Sometimes treasure's more sparkly in your imagination.

- Or it could be gold or baseball cards or pirate maps.

- Do you really think there could be pirate maps under there?

- I'm a hundred percent sure it's possible.

-  All right. I'm going in. - What?

- Really? Buddy.

- What do you see? 

- Nothing. It's really dark in here.

- Wait a minute. I think I see my truck.

- It's right over there by the- Uh-oh.

-  What? - I think I'm stuck.

-  How are you stuck? -My belt loop got caught on a pipe.

-  And it's hot. - Have you tried wiggling?

- Dad, it's hot! Hurry!

-  I'm coming, buddy! - And hurry. There's spiders in here.

- Coming!

- I'm sorry if we got all weird in there.

- No. It was fine.

- Well, we'd like to say it's different than how it usually is,

- but you've seen us enough to know that that's not true.

- Guys, listen. 

- I had a very complicated relationship with my mother.

- She was born in Japan- crazy traditional.

- She didn't want me to become a doctor.

- She wanted me to get married and have kids.

- But my father, we would talk...

- and he would actually listen to what I wanted.

- Anyway, what I'm trying to say...

- is having a mother isn't always what it's cracked up to be.

-  Oh! Thank you. - Well, thank you.

- And if you ask me,

- having two fathers who care as much as you do...

- makes Lily the luckiest little girl in the world.

-  Oh! Thank you so much. - Thank you. Thank you for that.

-  That's very sweet. Thanks. - Thank you.

- And how are things with you and your mom now?

- The only way she'll be happy is if I'm some Asian stereotype.

- But that just isn't me.

- I didn't see those!

-  I'm coming, buddy. - Over here.

- That's... a spider web. Oh, God.

- My boy was in trouble,

- so I put my fears aside, and I came to his rescue.

- Now, does that make me a hero?

- Yes, it does.

- Everything's gonna be okay.

- Hey. Everything's gonna be okay.

-  There. - Thanks, Dad.

- Hey, that's what dads do. Let's get out of here.

-  I want my truck. - Really?

- It was a Christmas gift.

- Could you go get it?

- Yeah. Yeah.

- Sure. Let's go- Let's go through it.

- Yeah. There it is.

- Got it.

-  You okay? -Yeah. Are you okay?

- You know what? I am okay.

- We did it.

- We're under the house.

- What the heck. We're down here.

-  Why don't we see what we got, huh? - Yeah.

- Two intrepid explorers...

- make their way on a journey

- Dead bodies!

- We called the police and got a bunch of detectives over.

- Turns out it was the last owner's Halloween decorations,

- which is pretty funny.

- Least I thought it was.

- Everybody's afraid of something, right?

- Heights, clowns, tight spaces.

- You like it, Jay?

- I did it! 

- Those are things you get over.

- But then there's our children.

- Will they fit in?

- Will they be safe?

- Those are fears you never get past.

- So sometimes all you can do...

- is take a deep breath, pull 'em close...

- and hope for the best.

-  Bye! - Eyes on the road.

-  Love you! - Eyes on the road.

- Oh, God.

- I mean, things don't always work out.

- Oh. Cam, I think she wants her doll.

-  I don't know where it is. - Mommy.

- Mommy.

- When you squeeze the doll, it says "Mommy."

-  Did-Did you know that - Not a clue.

- The doll says "Mommy."

-  The doll says "Mommy." - The doll says "Mommy."

- But you gotta love it when they do.

-  Hey, Dad. - Hmm?

- Mom says there's an old trunk in the attic.

- Oh, yeah. My grandpa's old steamer trunk.

- In this movie I saw, there was this old trunk...

- and there's a secret compartment.

- And when you opened it, there was a whole bunch of paintings,

- by the world's greatest painters, hidden in the war.

- My grandpa was in the war.

- Should we go up there? 

- Totally. It could also be diamonds.

- Or a samurai sword. 

- Or the Declaration of Independence.

- You know, it almost doesn't even matter what's up there.

- What matters is what you do with the money from what's up there.

- We could get a motorboat. 

- Or a robotic gutter cleaner.

-  Or an indoor pool. - Or a two-man submarine.

S01E17 
----------------------
- Hey, honey, Hugh Grant has a

- I'm in.

- Okay, well, Alex has a cello lesson at 11:00...

- and Junior Congress at noon.

- Doesn't she also have no boys at forever?

- Don't you have an eating disorder you need to attend to?

- Yeah, anyway, uh, we could see the 4:00 or the 6:20.

- Oh, actually, that's no good.

- I'm meeting my friend Denise for a drink.

- Denise? Do I know Denise?

- Yeah. You know, my old girlfriend.

- Oh, my God. Gross. I can't even picture you with a woman.

-  Thank you. - You had a girlfriend before Mom?

- Try two.

- Trust me. I had plenty of fun in my time.

- And then I met your mom.

- And thank you.

- So I guess she travels

- around selling makeup for a cosmetics company.

- She's in town for a week.

- You mean she's like a door-to-door salesman?

- If you were doing it, they'd call it a dork-to-dork salesman.

- My boy strikes like a rattlesnake!

- Oh, yeah? W-Well, you

- Wow. All right, well, we can see the movie tomorrow.

- Come on. It's time for your lesson.

- You mean her second lesson, because she just got schooled.

- What's wrong with me today?

- Shake it off, champ. It's not your day.

-  Ay, good morning, papi. -Is it?

- Ay, you're still sad because of that audition.

- That part was mine. I was born to play Tevye.

- Instead they give it to Rod Jackson?

- What does he know from suffering?

-  How are we doing? - A little better.

- But we're gonna go and throw ice cream at the problem.

- Well, if that doesn't work, this should do the trick.

- "What doesn't kill us makes us stronger."

- We can hang this in your room.

- You can see it every morning, start to internalize it.

- Pretty soon nothing will keep you down. 

- But it's not true.

- What are you talking about? 

- Lots of stuff that doesn't kill you makes you weaker.

- My friend's grandfather had a heart attack.

- Now he needs a machine to breathe.

- I've seen him- at the supermarket.

- Now he needs to drive one of those little, like

- That's right. Be negative. 

- It's just not a good poster, Jay.

- You're only making me stronger.

-  Did you pack the bread for the ducks? - Yes.

- Not the whole-wheat kind. The ducks don't like that.

- They're ducks, Mitchell. They don't care.

- We both believe that

- animals should play a big part in Lily's life.

- Having grown up on a farm, I was surrounded by them.

- They were more like brothers

- and sisters than just, you know, livestock.

- Delicious brothers and sisters.

- Life on a farm- they know what they're getting into.

- Eesh.

- Oh, wait.

-  Oh, it's the office. -Don't answer it.

- I have to.

- It's like this every Saturday. Just ignore it.

- Well, maybe it's not that this time. Hello?

- Yeah.

- That's nice.

- Holy- Shel? You all right, buddy?

- Oh, hell.

- Oh, there's four of 'em, Mitchell.

- They're giving her little duck kisses.

- Oh, she's laughing. I can't believe you're missing this.

- Well, why not, Cam? I've missed everything else.

- She rolled over when I was in Phoenix.

- She started scooting when I was in court.

- Well, just tell 'em you're not coming in. You do enough for 'em.

- Well, you know that. I know that. You know?

- The only one who doesn't know that is my sucky boss.

- He's the suckiest suck of all time.

- He's a miserable son of a bitch who...

- may have heard everything I just said.

-  Hi, honey. -Hey.

- When are you getting together with your gal pal?

- Actually, I was just checking on that.

- She's supposed to send me a message.

- Oh, you're Facebook friends.

- Sure am. She's one of my 447 friends.

- Everybody wants a slice.

- How long have you two been in touch with each other?

- Uh, she tracked me down about a year ago.

- What? What's- What's that sound?

- Mmm. Nothing.

- Oh. Here she is right now.

- "How about we meet at Le Reve at 7:30?"

- That sounds innocent enough- I mean

- drinks with an ex-girlfriend at an intimate French restaurant.

- Honey, you're doing that thing when you say what I want you to say 

- but your tone seems mean.

- Let me guess. Denise isn't married.

- Recently divorced. What's the big deal?

- Come on, Phil. You can't be that naive.

- Seriously, women in their 30s on the Internet are like- 

- they're like ninjas.

- They get into their little black outfits 

- and try and sneak their way into your marriage.

- That's not Denise.

- Here. Read some of her messages.

-  You're gonna feel silly. - Okay.

- "Hey, Phil. How's it going?"

- You can't add the sexy voice.

- "Hi, Phil. How's it going?"

- "So glad to hear your neck is better."

-  Are you seriously jealous? - No, 

- I am not jealous at all.

- I just happen to know women better than you do,

- and that woman wants a slice.

- Okay. Just to prove how wrong you are,

- I'm gonna invite her over here for drinks.

- Fine with me. Just hope it's fine with Denise.

- "Gee, Phil, I really had my heart set on Le Reve."

- That voice doesn't bother me.

- Kind of like it!

- Has he been acting weird around you?

- No, no. I've been avoiding him all morning.

- So you don't even know if he heard you.

- That's why we're doing this.

- And where are you? I only have a half hour for lunch.

- Hello, handsome. 

- So this is where it happened.

- Just turn off the phone,

- roll down the window and we'll see if you can hear me.

- Go around! We're re-creating a faux pas!

- Thank you. 

- Okay. Can you hear me now?

- Yeah, but just barely.

- Is this how loud you were talking?

- It might have been a little bit louder.

- There was traffic. I almost had to shout.

-  You almost had to what? - Shout.

-  Little bit louder now. - Shout.

-  Little bit louder now. - Shout!

- Really, Cam? My job is at stake here, and

- Oh, who are we kidding? You can obviously hear me.

- I am so screwed.

- Manny? Manny, come here a second, pal.

-  Huh? - I got some bad news, buddy.

- What is it? 

- Well, there's no easy way to say this.

- Shel Turtlestein is dead. 

- What? How?

- I was down here reading the paper,

- and I heard this commotion up in your room.

- So- so naturally, I go running up there.

- And this mangy raccoon had busted through your screen.

- He must have scampered up to where Shel was.

- By the time I walked in, he had

- the little bastard had him by the neck and shaking him.

- Gravel was flying everywhere.

- He didn't even flinch.

- He just stared at me with that smug look and then bolted.

- If only I'd have got here earlier.

- May I see the body?

- Baby, are you sure that's a good idea?

- It's something I have to do.

-  That's him. - Sorry, pal.

- It just doesn't make any sense.

- Yep. Only the good die young.

- But in school, we learn raccoons are nocturnal.

- They sleep during the day.

- They sure do, and this one must've got up for a midnight snack.

- You know, we've all done that.

-  I guess so. -Yeah.

- It all adds up.

- I don't think I can be in here right now. Too many memories.

- He'll be okay.

-  You lie. - What?

- I'm Colombian. I know a fake crime scene when I see one.

- I was hanging up the new poster

- and it fell on top of him. It was an accident.

- You have to tell him.

- No. I've been through this before.

- When Mitchell was nine, I was supposed to take care of his bird.

- It got out and flew into a fan.

- It was like a bloody pillow fight.

- My God. How many pets have you killed?

- Just the two.

- I took the heat on the bird. It was a big mistake.

- To this day, Mitchell looks at me,

- I see him thinking,

- "That's the guy who killed Fliza Minnelli."

- And what if he finds out? Then what?

- You'll be the guy that killed his pet and lied to him.

- He's not gonna find out because I covered my tracks.

- Okay.

- Fliza Minnelli?

- How did I not know that kid was gay?

- Hey, Luke.

- Big day for you, huh?

- Why?

-  Because you will get to meet your real mom. - What?

- We all made a pact we'd deny it until you turned 21.

- But that's the real reason Dad's old girlfriend's coming over.

- She's your mom,

- and if she likes you, you'll go live with her.

- I'm not adopted. I'm asking Mom.

- You mean Mrs. Dunphy? She's not going to tell you the truth.

- I-I'm not

- I know.

- Just 'cause he called you a dork-to-dork salesman?

- The empire shakes back.

- Raccoons have five toes.

- What's that? 

- I don't mean to bother you.

- It's just confusing.

- The footprints in my room only have four toes.

- You know, I bet I know what happened.

- I'll bet he lost those toes in a fight.

- And that guy looked like he'd been in a brawl or two.

-  One toe from each foot? - Maybe.

- You know, Manny, I think the only thing...

- that's gonna get you to stop asking all these questions...

- is for you to have a little closure.

- What do you mean? 

- Well,I'd like to throw a little memorial for Shel.

- It'll be good for all of us. 

- That way we get our grief out,

- and then we never have to talk about this ever, ever again.

- Hi. Oh, careful. There's a thing.

- Yeah. Good to see you.

-  Hi! Oh, my God. - Hi. I'm Claire.

- You must be- Oh. Yeah. Hi.

-  Denise. - Well- Okay.

- You're even prettier than the pictures that Phil's always posting.

-  Just a couple. - Oh?

- Shut up. Every week.

- He loves showing you off.

- And my boyfriend likes your Acapulco pictures,

- probably a little too much.

- Well, thank your boyfriend for me.

- Come on in, please.

- Oh, I brought you, um, some lifting intensifier.

- Not that you need it. It's a limited edition,

-  Thank you. Thank you. - Never mind.

- Oh, Denise, I think you might know these people.

-  Uh, that's Haley - Hi.

-  Alex and- - Luke.

- I had curly hair just like that when I was little.

- So? That doesn't mean anything.

- Why don't we, uh, come on in, have a seat. Please.

- So what was my dad like in high school?

- Only the most amazing break-dancer ever.

-  No way. - Oh, don't fire it up. What? What?

- He had a boom box and a piece of cardboard in his locker.

-  And what was your dance name? - O-Zone.

- I drove him to his Star Search audition.

- Which is totally political, by the way.

- O-Zone.

- That is dead-ass funny. I'm so calling you that. 

- Thank you.

- Wow. You really lucked out.

- You have a beautiful wife, a gorgeous house. 

- And those kids- I could take Luke home with me.

- Well, be my guest.

- Seriously, you go right ahead.

- No! I like it here!

- Alex, honey, will you go find out what's wrong with your brother?

- Okay.

- You know, um, if it's okay, I think I'm just gonna use the, um

- Oh, yeah. Of course. Down the hall.

-  Left-hand side. You can't miss it. - Thanks.

-  Okay, she's fantastic. -Yes?

- Yes. I feel awful. 

- When did I become this horribly cynical person...

- who assumes the worst about people?

- I first noticed it seven years- You're not.

- Such an idiot. Is it

-  Oh, I'll show you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Okay. Thanks.

- So how are we gonna do this?

- I thought I'd just point at the door.

-  So I was thinking - I was thinking too.

- Here... is my hotel room key.

- You can come by whenever you want.

- That was funny this morning, huh

- when I pulled up next to you at that stoplight?

- Funny?

- Yeah. Because I was on the phone with my partner...

- talking about how horrible his boss was- his.

- And then you pull up. So

- Anyway, I'm glad I ran into you.

- I'm getting worried they're gonna move up our court date.

- I need you to bust ass preparing. 

- 'Cause if they call us on Monday

- Uh, you need to get that?

- No. It's fine. It's just a...

- picture of my daughter standing for the first time.

- Yeah, they do that. It's a big day.

- Anyway, I need you here tomorrow.

- I know it's a Sunday, but,

- uh, you think you can be on time, okay?

- Actually, um, I have plans tomorrow,

- uh, so I won't be here.

- I-I have plans to stay at home

- with my family and do absolutely nothing. Okay.

- But I will see you on Monday.

- So, you're in charge now, is that it?

- Well, I just figure if my daughter can stand up,

- then so can I.

- All right, look. We've all been working hard lately, okay?

- But that's the job. 

- So either come in tomorrow or don't bother coming back again.

- Okay.

- Need the, uh, I.D. to

- make the elevator go down to freedom...

- and this to complete my set.

- Turtle, reptile, pet.

- Shel Turtlestein was many things.

- I don't think I can do this without crying.

- Maybe we should just get to the cold cuts.

- Well, we wanna hear it.

- Jay, why don't you read it?

- You were with him at the end. Remember?

- "Shel Turtlestein was many things,"

- "but above all, he was my friend."

- "When I didn't get a date with Fiona Gunderson,"

- "Shel was there."

- "When I didn't get to play the part of Tevye,"

- "Shel was there."

- "And when a raccoon broke into my room,"

- "unfortunately, Shel was there.

- "I said a lot of things to my friend,"

- "but the one thing I never got to say was good-bye."

- Stop. I know what really happened.

-  You do? - I left a bag of chips near my bed.

- The raccoon must have smelled it. It's my fault he's dead.

- Sorry, Shel.

- Jay, you don't have anything to say to Manny?

- Yeah.

- Manny.

- Shel forgives you.

- Thank you.

- Oh, Denise.

- These pictures are amazing. Thank you.

- Sweetie, that perm.

- Technically, that's a Jheri curl.

- I just love to take pictures. I took this one of myself today.

- You know what? I'm gonna open a bottle of wine.

- No. No. That's the worst idea.

- No, no. I'm not in the mood.

- What am I, raised by a pack of wolves?

- Hey. Come on now.

- Honey.

- You weren't completely wrong about Denise.

-  How's that? - She wants me.

-  To do what? - It. Her.

- Oh. Oh, this is because of the thing I said about Facebook...

- and everybody's hooking up, and now you're disappointed.

- No. She bit the air right in front of me. Like that.

- And then look what she tried to give me.

-  Anything I can help with? - No.

- I just- I can't find my corkscrew.

-  Touch me. - Okay. Denise,

- I think somewhere along the line you got the wrong idea.

- My head is full of wrong ideas.

-  You have such great taste, Claire. - Thank you.

- I remember Phil used to have really good taste too.

-  Let me get a little of this. - Oh, here it is.

- Phil, would you mind grabbing us a couple glasses?

- You betcha.

-  Need me to grab anything? - No!

-  Okay, this is so wrong. - I know.

-  It's way more exciting when she's in the room, isn't it? -No.

- I still have my cheerleader outfit.

- So do I.

- But this still can't happen. When did that break?

-  Why are you wussing out? - I never wussed in.

- What about all those things you wrote on Facebook?

- "How was your day? My neck is so sore."

- Why do people keep adding voices to these things?

- I didn't mean anything.

- Are you telling me that I wasted a year 

- of my life on this relationship?

- What relationship? 

- How many other women have you led on?

- No, I don't know! 

- Phil?

- Phil, honey.

- Do you remember when you broke your arm 

- when we were first dating?

- Yeah, uh, when I slipped on the ice.

- Right. That's so weird. Because in this picture,

- you're sitting with Denise and you have a broken arm, so

- Yeah, that's- that's weird.

-  So you were still dating her when you started dating me? - No.

-  Phil? - Yeah. Maybe.

- There was a time, a little overlap...

- when, uh, I was trying to break things off with Denise.

- You took me to Santa Fe.

- Santa Fe? Phil, you told me that was your father.

- Okay, I know the pain is fresh, but the lie is really old.

- You know, this was a mistake. I'm gonna leave.

- Claire, if I were you, I would kick him out.

- Maybe he'd appreciate you

- more after he spent a lonely night in a hotel.

- At the Radisson, by the airport.

-  You quit? - It was amazing.

- No, no. This is the new me, Cam.

- I am not letting people run my life anymore.

- I should be nervous, but I'm not. I'm excited for you.

- Yes! It's exciting! It's exciting.

- Because you followed your heart, and that is worth celebrating.

- Cam, I just feel

- so liberated.

- And I'm not picking it up.

-  I like this guy. - I do too.

- Yes, we'll have to cut back a little bit.

- But isn't it worth it if you feel

- like you're living your life for the first time?

-  Totally. - What were we even waiting for?

- You will go back to teaching music,

- and then I'll just find something in a... few months.

- And until then, all we need to do is just sit back...

- and watch this little miracle here dazzle us.

-  I'm tingling. - I am too.

- It's like my heart is full for the first time in forever.

- Oh, God, it's really pounding.

- It's like I feel the weight of

- endless possibilities just sitting on my chest

- She is not doing anything, Cam.

- You're not panicking, are you?

-  Of course I am panicking. - No. Don't panic. 

- If you panic, I panic!

- I just quit my job. Cam! My God.

- Mitchell, I am used to nice things.

- What are we gonna do? 

- Okay. No, no. Just calm down.

- This is what we're gonna do.

- I am going to- I'm gonna do what I'm trained to do.

- I am going to lie, grovel, debase myself 

- until I get what I want.

- I am a lawyer, damn it.

- Mitchell!

- No.

- Oh, no, you're right. The tie.

- No. We'll find something better for you,

- something that works for all of us.

- There's no Plan "B" here, Cam.

- We have a mortgage. We have- We have a child to support.

- Hey, it's gonna be okay.

- We're gonna figure it out.

- I just want you to be happy, and you will be happy.

- And that is something worth toasting.

- Let's just drink the cheap stuff,

- 'cause we might have to sell that bottle.

- It's hard to sleep in a bed of lies.

- Isn't it, Jay? 

- Kids get over these things pretty quick.

- He's probably sleeping like a baby right now.

- I'm sure he's wide awake, full of guilt.

- Well, I'm going to sleep.

- Damn it!

- Hello, Jay.

-  What are you doing up? - Waiting.

- Waiting for what? 

- The truth. It wasn't a raccoon, was it?

- Oh, all right. You got me. I killed Shel.

- All right? I'm sorry. It was an accident.

- Why didn't you just tell me?

- Because I didn't want you to be upset with me.

- You and I got off to a rocky start.

- Lately, it's been pretty good.

- I was afraid I'd mess all that up

- if you knew that I was the one that killed your pet.

- Now you're the guy who killed my pet 

- and made a stupid lie about it.

- Well, I don't think it was stupid.

- I thought it was pretty clever.

- I was just trying to avoid past mistakes.

- Look.

- I know I can't make things all better right now, 

- but maybe over time.

- Maybe.

- Get some rest.

- Since we're confessing things,

- you know that scratch on your car?

- The one that can't be buffed out? Yeah?

- You should probably know how it happened.

- I know how it happened.

- Raccoon did it.

-  Good night, Jay. -Good night, kid.

- Best thing I ever did 

- was quit a miserable job and start my own business.

-  Thanks, Dad. - No, it's not gonna be easy.

- That's why Gloria and I wanna give you a little something 

- to help you through it.

- No, Dad, I can't.

- No. I want to, Mitch.

- Okay, but, I mean, as soon as I'm back on my feet, I really want to

- Oh. Oh, Dad. No. You

- You tried to give me this 20 years ago when my pet snake died.

-  I did? -Yes.

-  Zsa Zsa Gaboa? - Oh, that's adorable.

- And you really didn't know that he was gay?

- I must've, right?

S01E18 
----------------------
- What's my favorite way to relax?

- Throw on my wireless headphones

- and disappear into the Nature Channel.

- The young flatback turtle searches for food on the ocean floor.

- This flatback, however

- The fascinating thing about nature...

- is how, in the blink of an eye,

- it can go from a scene of total tranquil beauty...

- to raw, primal violence.

- Can you seriously not hear me with those things on?

- It's noise-canceling technology. Give it a spin. It's got

-  Sweetie, focus, now. - Mom,

- why are you freaking out on everyone?

- Because you are acting very irresponsibly- all of you.

- Listen, honey.

- Luke has a giant project due tomorrow for school

- that he hasn't even started,

- and Haley just informed me

- she needs 40 cupcakes for her school fund-raiser,

- also due tomorrow.

- I'd like to point out

- I completed all my assignments on my own and on time.

-  Not now, Alex.  -Ok, look,

- I will take the cupcakes. You do the project.

-  It's on Vincent Van Gogh. - Done!

- Ok, I need you to really stay on him.

- Keep him focused.

- All right. I'm actually gonna take a different approach, but

- Actually gonna insist that you don't.

- Claire, I know you've got your methods,

- but so do I.

- And I'm sorry, but I'm not a micromanager.

- Trust me, I can provide Luke

- with the tools and guidance he needs...

- without, uh, smothering him.

- You think I smother our child?

- It's not your fault, honey.

- "Mother" Is part of the word.

- You never hear of anyone being "Sfathered" to death.

- I know what Luke's problem is.

- He's got A.D.H.D.

-  No. - No, I don't!

-  What is it? - I'd tell you,

- but you'd wander off before I got to the "H."

- Just promise me that you will stay on him

- until this project is done.

- I will, but you might have a little more confidence in him.

- Wah! Wah! No one can hear me now.

- Everybody is stupid except me.

- Ha, ha, ha. I am funny.

- Is this the cutest thing I've ever seen?

- You out here on the curb with your little telescope,

- waiting for your dad.

- It's not cute. It's-lt's science.

- Tonight is the magnificent Lyrid meteor shower.

- It's where the planet Geek passes through the Nerdy Way. It

- Oh, you know I think it's sweet.

- Every couple years, Mitchell and his father go out

- and enjoy one of these showers together.

- Oh, I- I wouldn't necessarily put it that way.

- I mean, yes, me and my father enjoy it,

- because we don't share a lot of the same interests.

- Like, um, I-I never went to sports games with him.

- Probably because you call 'em "Sports games."

-  Just lose the "Sports." - Just- Just games.

- Oh, here comes your shower partner.

- Stop it.

- I'm kidding. Have fun with your dad, okay?

- All right. See you later.

-  Don't worry about me. - I'm not.

- I'm just saying, if you were.

- Shotgun, sucka!

- Make sure your seat is exactly the way you want it,

- and feel free to play with any of these controls up here.

- I have no idea what they do.

- But I want mi car to be su car.

- Cameron, are you okay? You seem nervous.

- Uh, nervous? No. I'm not nervous.

- I was nervous.

- I mean, when Mitchell made plans with his father,

- I figured, why not spend the evening with Gloria?

- I've always wanted to be good friends with her.

- On paper, we should be good friends.

- Look at us. One spicy, curvy diva

- And Gloria.

- The problem is, I had a little minor setback

- that we had to overcome from a couple weeks ago.

- I cannot stand hanging out with his lvy League friends.

-  Oh, they're the worst. - They're not that bad.

-  They are the worst! - Are you kidding me?

- Debbie can't go two minutes

- without talking about Columbia University.

- And the little guy with the lazy eye from Harvard.

- Brown.

- Whatever.

- Honestly, I wish that tart would go back to Columbia...

- and take her weird little Brown friend with her.

- Cam, you need to relax. You explained.

- Not very well.

- You know how awkward I get when things get awkward.

- So when I said "Brown people,"

- I wasn't talking about your, uh, brown people.

- I was talking about people who go to a university.

- Um, not your people.

- N-Not that your people couldn't go to college.

- Okay, now I'm hearing myself

- say "Your people" a lot, so

- Um, just very excited because this is, um

- you know, this is our first night out together,

- so it's our little date.

- Where are we going?

- Make sure your seat belt is securely fastened...

- and your tray tables are in the upright position...

- because I got us into Palaiseau!

-  Ah! Fancy! -I know.

- It's normally a four-week wait,

- but the matre d' is an old Pilates brother of mine,

- so just one phone call.

- Okay.

- Palaiseau!

- Ay, Cameron, you know what?

- I don't know if I'm in the mood for something so fancy.

- Can we just go somewhere, like, more simple?

- Oh, uh, yes. Yes, of course.

- We can- What were- What did you have in mind?

- I don't know.

- How 'bout a little Latin place that I always used to go?

-  That sounds fantastic. - Okay.

- I would love to see how your people eat.

- "Your people"?

- What is wrong with me?

- Okay. It's egg-crackin' time.

- Now, I find the key to cracking an egg properly

- Mom, I'm not a child. I can do it.

-  Okay. - Okay.

- Okay.

- My mom's not dumb.

- You can't just ask her to do something for you.

- You have to very carefully put the cheese in the trap.

- Oh. Oops. I got a little shell in the bowl.

- When that happens, I find that I like to...

-  Do not do that. - I got it. It's okay.

-  Oh, that's- that's really gross. - Okay. I'm gonna- I'll do this.

- You just mop up.

- And snap.

- Is it bad that I feel sorry for her?

-  So how do I start? -What do you think?

- I don't know. Mom usually tells me what to do.

- Join the club. I'm kidding. I love your mom.

- We are going to try a new approach this time.

- Now, your goal is to create a display

- about the life and art of Van Gogh, right?

-  Yeah. - Okay. You got your poster board right here.

- So, pretend you're telling the story of his life...

- to someone who has never heard of him.

- What do you put on that board?

- I see the wheels spinning. A spark of crea

- How do they get the lead in pencils?

- Ok, Let's try to stay on topic.

- Hey, Jay. Look who thinks

- Mercury is the densest planet in the solar system.

- I take it from your mocking tone that I am incorrect.

- Densest planet is Earth.

- Which makes you the densest guy on the densest planet.

-  Zing! -Fine.

- You sure Mitchell won't mind me tagging along?

- Are you kidding? He loves ya.

- What are you worried about?

- I've never had a brother before.

- We never really hung out that much.

- Kiddo, you are overthinking this.

- I just don't wanna say the wrong thing.

- You can't. That's the beauty of having a brother.

- Me and my brother were zinging each other all the time.

- You know, like, "What's going on, fat boy?"

- "Nothing much, jackass."

- You know, things of that nature.

- It's- It's how brothers express love.

- Shotgun, sucka!

- Yeah. That's good.

- I'm gonna see the sights.

- Not if they see you first!

- Kind of missed with that one, kid.

- All right.

- This is all you need to know right here.

- Apparently, the pencil's in two pieces,

- and they glue 'em together on the lead.

- What if we put all the stuff about his life on this side...

- and all the stuff about his paintings on this side?

- Luke, buddy, that's fantastic!

- And the best part is, you came up with that by yourself.

- All it took was a little bit of focus and, uh

- This thing is really loose.

- I'm gonna go grab a screwdriver. But you run with this.

- On your mark, get set, Van Gogh.

- Hey, Dad. He kind of looks like Uncle Mitchell,

- if Uncle Mitchell were insane.

- I got sprayed by a skunk!

- Oh, you stink!

- And not just at astronomy! Blammo!

- What is happening?

- I love this place.

- I was a little bit worried because it's not exactly

- I... love... this place.

- I... was... nervous.

- I mean, there was a lot of different food on the menu,

- and on the floor, and on the wall.

- Are we sure we're not exaggerating just a little bit?

- Were you there, Mitchell?

- Because I think I would have recognized

- the only other white or gay person.

- I'd already offended Gloria once.

- Not gonna do it again.

-  Mi amigo Cameron. - Ah, welcome.

-  So, carnitas diablos. - Ah, you remember.

- Um, I'll just have the same thing.

- No, no, no. You should have the chicken enchiladas.

- No, I'll have the carnitas diablos.

-  These are not for you. - Excuse me?

- They're too spicy.

- Miss Gloria's used to it.

- Yeah, he's right.

- I can spice you under the table any day there, sweet thing.

- Dos carnitas diablos, por favor.

- Okay.

- Okay.

-  Mitchell! - Of course. What was I thinking?

- Dad, can we- can we just go home, please?

- You've got to air out first before I let you in that car.

- I'll never get the stink out.

- Hey, Jay, is that Venus?

- 'Cause I can smell the clouds of pure sulfuric acid from here.

-  Slam! - Okay. I-I'd really like to go home now.

- We'll miss the meteor shower.

- The trouble is your clothes.

- Just take them off. I think there's a blanket in the trunk.

- You sure, Dad?

- You're not worried I might stink up the blanket?

- Don't worry about it.

- We just use it to cover up the seat

- for when Manny's all sweaty after his tango class.

- If you don't sweat, you're not doing it right.

- He was one of the best boyfriends I ever had.

-  But he was gay. - Yeah.

- I figured that out after the first month

- And I stayed for a whole year

- because the haircuts were fantastic!

- It's funny, huh?

- Cameron, that one is not that funny.

-  Are you okay? - I'm fine.

-  Are you sure? - I love this place.

- But your head is running water.

- No, I don't think it is.

- I told you it was too spicy for you. Look at your shirt.

-  I just need to get a bit of a drink of something. - No, no, no!

- Cameron, the water makes it so worse. No!

- Oh, you're right. That does make it worse.

- Oh- I feel like I ate the sun!

- And that is the secret to no lumps.

- See? It's kind of fun.

-  You make it fun, Mom. - Mmm.

- Listen to these symptoms of A.D.H.D.

-  And tell me it's not Luke. - Alex!

- "Easily distracted by irrelevant stimuli."

- "Often impulsively abandons one task for another."

- That's where I left those.

- "A tendency to act without regard to consequences,

- often at the expense of personal safety."

-  "Having accidents more often"  -Ok, you know what?

- I think that's enough, Alex. We've got it.

- Oh, no. No!

- Phil. Phil! Honey, are you okay?

- Yeah. Remember those sunglasses I couldn't find?

- Bingo!

- I asked you to do one thing- stay on top of Luke.

- For your information,

- your son is hard at work on an awesome Van Gogh

- Gotta fix that- masterpiece.

- Wait'll you see. You're gonna be so surprised.

- Oh, God, honey.

- I want nothing more than to be surprised, really.

- I'm not surprised.

- Okay, that's it. I don't want to hear anything

- about your new method of doing things.

- There's one thing that works with these kids,

- and that is staying on top of them,

- which, thanks to you, my friend,

- I will now be able to do all night long.

- Not happy, dude.

- You're supposed to be working.

- I am working.

- Mr. Potato Head, really?

-  I know what you think, but- - No, I don't wanna hear it.

- I'm going down to clean up the garage,

- then I'm coming back and I'm gonna stand over you

- until this thing is done, okay?

-  Breathe. - Breathing only makes the fire spread.

- Okay. Then drink this milk.

- Ay, Cam. Why did you have to order that spicy dish?

- Because I'm, um, a big idiot...

- and I wanted to have this awesome night between the two of us...

- where we end up best friends,

- uh, having lunch, buying shoes.

- Okay! Let's go have lunch, let's go buy shoes.

-  Really? - Yeah. Why are you so surprised?

- Well, I don't know. I guess i just always

- feel like I blow it with you, Gloria

- whether it's the Columbian comment...

- or picking the wrong restaurant.

- The restaurant had nothing to do with you.

- I was just not in the mood to go anywhere that fancy...

- after the stupid thing I did this morning.

- What did you do?

-  I bought a dress. - You monster.

- Ay. It was a very expensive dress that I don't need.

- I felt so stupid that when I got home,

- I couldn't even bring it inside the house.

-  I left it in the car. - I totally get it.

- I have a legendary hat story.

- I'll bet you look fabulous in that dress.

- Yes, but anyone would look fabulous in that dress.

-  You find that blanket? - No.

- This was all I could find. Shut up!

-  Really shows off your shape. - Okay.

- Spin around, cupcake. Let's see the caboose!

- You get fries with that shake?

- Was that too far?

- There's a line, Jay.

- I better go mop this up.

- Oh, come on. Where's the

- I'm sorry if things got a little out of hand back there,

- but in our defense, look at you.

- I mean, smell you.

- This is a fantastic apology.

- Oh, don't be too hard on the kid. I was egging him on.

- You're gonna be mad, be mad at me.

- Done!

- I was just happy to see him laugh a little bit.

- You know, he's had kind of a tough week.

- I got sprayed by a skunk,

- and I'm wearing a dress that makes my hips look huge.

- I know he doesn't want me to talk about it,

- but he didn't get invited to this big party.

- Some kids he thought were his friends

- think he's weird.

- Now, you know me on this. I'm no- I'm no good at it.

- You know, I- I never know what to say.

- That's true.

- But maybe I raised a kid who would know what to say.

- That's the only reason I invited him along

- you know, because this astronomy stuff,

- that's- that's our thing.

- Yeah. No, I'll talk to him.

- You know, you don't look that ridiculous.

-  Now, you actually got the legs for it. - Dad.

- No, I'm just saying,

-  if you were that type of a gay- - Dad!

- You'd probably do all right for yourself.

- Come on!

- You know, I always had a sense it was dangerous down here,

- but I guess it's actually kind of charming, isn't it?

- No, it's not safe at all.

-  I used to live down here, you know. - What?

- Yeah, that's why I come down here. Look there.

- That was my old apartment.

- After I left Javier, that's all I could afford.

- It's still part of me.

- You have to remember those things,

- like you when you go to your farm.

- You remember that? I told you that a year ago.

- Of course I do. You're my friend, you big idiot.

- You know, this part of town might be very rough,

- but the people here, Cameron- the best.

- I'm pretty sure I had wheels when I parked here.

- Ayayay! Who did this?

-  No, it's okay, Gloria. - Who did this?

- You coward son of bitches!

- It's okay, everybody! I'm- I'm insured!

- What? What? You scared?

- You scared to show your face, little girl?

-  No, it's all right, everybody! - Cameron, wait in the car!

-  Cameron! - Gloria, I think it's drivable.

- Gloria!

- Just so you know, I'm going back up to Luke's room,

-  and I'm not leaving until he's finished. - Thank you.

- And I'm really sorry for not underestimating Luke enough.

- Well, that means a lot to me.

- The hardest part is, he kinda takes after me with all this.

- Like my lack of focus and your

-  My what? - I just love you.

- I did it.

- Oh, my God.

- Do you like it?

- I-I- I love it.

-  Did you do this? -All him.

- I used Mr. Potato Head ears

- because Van Gogh cut his ear off.

- And there's money

- because his paintings sell for, like, a bajillion dollars,

- which is sad because he died broke.

- Yes. That

-  You were right. -Don't apologize.

-  I'm not apologizing. -Apology accepted.

- Luke, I-I really couldn't be more proud of you,

- and I am so sorry I didn't give you more credit.

-  Thanks. - Way to go, buddy.

- Gotta go finish the cupcakes.

- No. She didn't.

-  Sweetie, can you hand me those? - Uh-huh.

- Yeah, I can talk.

- What are you doing?

- I showed you how to make 'em,

- and now you can do it yourself.

- Come on, guys. Let's go.

- Well, good, because I really wanted to.

- Okay. I'm setting the oven to 700!

- I'm putting, uh- I'm putting the eggs in the bowl!

- Oh, I got some shells in 'em! Uh-oh!

- Are you serious?

-  Hey. - Hey, Mitchell.

- So, I know you'd never, um

- I know you'd never,

- never believe this by looking at me right now,

- but, um, I used to get picked on at school too.

-  So Jay told you? - Yeah.

- Yeah, they would, um- they'd call me weird.

- I was weird. Uh, fun weird.

- But I- This is the funny thing about growing up.

- For years and years, everybody's desperately afraid...

- to be different, you know, in any way.

- And then, suddenly, almost overnight,

- everybody wants to be different,

- and that is where we win.

-  I'm sort of counting on that. - Yeah.

-  I'm sorry I was picking on you too much. -Ah, that's

- Jay said that's what brothers do.

- Well, we don't have to listen to him.

-  Brothers do that too. - Okay, ladies.

- Finish up your tea party.

- You're missing the show.

- Can't believe I was fighting over this guy, huh?

- Check it out. Check it out.

-  Wow. - Awesome!

- Why did he paint The Starry Night?

- Maybe because the sky is beautiful,

- and everybody likes looking at it,

- and it reminds us

- that something's up there watching over all of us

- aliens, who could be here in a second...

- to liquefy us and use us as fuel.

- So wake up, people. We're next.

- Mom!

- You better get down here!

- Oh, my God.

- Wow! Delicious!

- I am so proud.

- Oh! Thanks, Mom. I'm just gonna wrap these up.

- No. You know what, sweetie?

- You're gonna be late for school. Just go.

- I'll bring 'em by later.

-  Are you sure? -Yeah!

-  Get out of here, Betty Crocker. - Okay.

- I'm so proud of you!

- Do we still have the number for Poison Control?

- I love you, Claire. I'll always love you!

- My mouth is asleep, like at the dentist.

- Get over here, buddy.

S01E19 
----------------------
- Today Sam Riley kicked a soccer ball...

- and it hit another kid so hard his eye popped out.

- Awesome!

- Really? His eye popped out.

-  Never mind. - Well, gotta hit the sack. Big Saturday tomorrow.

- That's right. It's somebody's birthday.

- Not just that. The iPad comes out

- on my actual birthday.

- It's like Steve Jobs and God got together to say,

- "We love you, Phil."

- What is so great about that doohickey anyhow?

- "Doohickey," Elly May?

- It's a movie theater, a library and a music store...

- all rolled into one awesome pad.

- A library is a place where people get books.

- A movie theater is a place where people go on dates.

- I better load the beach chair into the trunk.

- I'm gonna need it for the line in the morning.

- Wait, honey. Hang on. 

- You can't spend your birthday in line.

- Well, not the whole day.

- I have to be there at 6:00, you'll forget about it.

-  Then I'm out by 10:00. - Why don't you let me do it?

- Claire, you don't have to do that.

- No, I know, but I want to.

- And that way on your birthday

- you'll wake up and you'll have your brand-new toy.

- Okay.

- Well, in spite of you calling it a toy,

- this is shaping up to top the best birthday I ever had.

- Oh, thank God we don't have to hear that stupid story

-  about that place... - It was called the Fun Zone.

- I was 11.

- I hit 10 straight fastballs in the batting cage.

- Then my best friend Jeff Sweeney stepped in

- and took one in the groin.

- I yelled out "Ball two!"

- Everybody laughed.

- That was when I knew I was funny.

- Good night.

- B-E-L-I-E-V-E. Believe.

- Are you sure there's not an "E-I" In the middle?

-  No. It's "I-E." - Good, papi!

- If I can't fool you, then your teachers can't fool you either.

- I don't think they're trying to fool me.

- Wait until you see what I got Phil for his birthday.

- I found it on the SkyMall catalog.

- Ay. It's not one of those talking alarm clocks?

- "It's 6:05. It's 6:25. Wake up. Wake up."

- Even better. A rosewood chess set.

- As matter of fact, before I wrap this thing,

- what say we take it for a spin?

- Come on, Manny. I'll teach you.

- He knows how to play. His father taught him.

- I'm gonna teach him real chess, not the Colombian version.

- We actually use the pieces to play the game,

- not smuggle stuff out of the country.

- I know one Colombian piece you won't be playing with later.

- Manny, come on. Let's see what you got. 

- You'll be surprised.

- Manny's an excellent player, but Jay is a grumpy loser.

- He mopes, he makes the face, he slams the door,

- then he said he didn't slam the door.

- It's better that he wins.

- Um, I got this.

- Everything's gonna be okay.

- It's okay. It's okay.

-  Cam! - Leave me alone.

- There's a...there's a man in Lily's room.

- There's a man in Lily's room!

- It's go time.

- Oh, thank God.

- It's me, it's me, it's me, it's me.

- She's fine.

- We must have just heard a neighbor with the same monitor.

- Thank God.

- Boy, if a spider would have broken in here,

- he would have been in trouble.

- Light-up barbecue tongs.

- This was the lame gift I got Phil.

- So, was I bummed to get up at 5:00 and wait in line?

- No. No, because I was finally getting my husband

- something that he really, really wanted.

- I was every bit as excited as he was.

- No.

- Hey, buddy.

- I hope you're not upset about our chess match yesterday.

- Hey, what do you say we play again?

-  I'm good. - That's the spirit.

- Downloaded this for you. 

- It's kind of a kid's guide to chess.

- No, Jay. I'm good.

- Nah, it's not all dry like that. They have fun with it.

- See, you can color in the little players with your crayons.

- Now you are making me want to play again.

- Now we're lighting a fire. Let me toss this out.

- If you beat me, if that day should ever come,

- I'll give you

-  I want your watch. - Wow, you had that loaded up.

- Okay. Game on.

- Now, I want you to go first.

- Now remember, try to open up the middle of the board.

- I'd have moved that guy two spaces.

- More aggressive.

- And you don't want to bring your queen out that quickly.

- See, now you could've protected that with that,

- but now you're vulnerable

-  Checkmate. - Huh? What?

- How'd you do that?

- You will not believe what's going on

- at Jake and Debbie's house.

- Who? -The people on the monitor. They must live nearby.

- So much drama.

- Okay, Jake told Debbie that he had to work late.

- So she called his boss 

- and found out that he didn't. Busted!

- So she spent all morning on the phone

- crying and crying and crying to her mother...

- and said if Jake has to work "late" one more time,

- she's filing for divorce.

- That's it? I give you that tasty dish

- and all you give me is a "Huh"?

- I-I'm s- Cam, I froze last night.

- I froze. 

- I thought Lily was in danger and I froze.

- But not you. No, you sprung right into action.

- You even had the cool "It's go time" line.

- That comes to me naturally. I spent a year as a crossing guard.

- Cam, I mean, what kind of parent am I

- if I can't even protect my own family, you know?

- Just once I would love to be the guy with no fear...

- who can stand up and, I don't know, you know, kick some ass.

- You're so cute when you're angry with your little fists.

- Just wanna put you in my pocket.

- Think he's coming.

-  He's coming? - Here he comes.

-  Dad! - Happy birthday!

- You guys! That's awesome.

-  Oh, who are these from? - Cam and Mitchell.

- Those guys are a class act.

- We're making you breakfast.

- French waffle cakes.

- Let me guess: One waffle in between two pieces of French toast

- wrapped in a pancake.

- Nailed it.

- Bring it in here, monkeys.

- Love you! Get over here!

- Good enough.

- Where's Mom?

- You mean the greatest woman in the world?

- She is standing in line at the Apple Store,

- making all my birthday wishes come true.

- Let's see how these bad boys taste.

-  Oh, no... - Son of a... Oh! It's hot!

-  Are you okay? - Fresh out of the oven? That is...

-  Do you want some ice? - Yes.

- Oh, man! This...

-  Oh, that feels better. That feels better. - Sorry, Dad.

- No, it actually- That feels weird. 

- That burns in a different way!

- Don't wash this until we see if I can get my skin back. Okay?

- Let me see it!

- No! Your party's not until tonight.

- You're just gonna have to wait.

- Just let me see the bag. Did you leave it in the car?

-  Yeah! - Hey, who'd you deal with?

- Was it a guy named Mehar? They call him "The beast."

- He's a tiny guy. He must've move a ton of product.

- I kinda love that you're making me wait.

- You are the best wife ever!

- You are the best wife ever!

- I didn't get you the iPad.

- I got to the store and they were all out.

- I'm so sorry.

- I don't understand. My online buddies got it.

- SAT800 and Brobot didn't get there until 8:00.

- And you definitely got there before they did,

- because you got there at 6:30.

- No, no, no! You didn't get there at 6:30? Where were you?

- I set the alarm for 5:00.

- I got up, I came downstairs, I fell asleep.

- No! Oh, my goodness. 

- What have I done? What have I done?

-  I should've done this myself. - Sweetie, you know what? 

- They're gonna get more in next week.

- Next week?

- That's the worst thing you can say to an early adopter.

- Where are you going?

- To a place where birthdays still mean something.

- I'll get that.

-  Hi, Manny. - Mitchell?

- What are you doing here at... 

- 4:17 on a Saturday afternoon?

- Oh, I'm just returning my dad's belt of tools, so

- At 4:17 on a Saturday afternoon?

- Don't you have something better to do?

-  So, were you a big hit? - What do you mean?

- Well, I just assumed there was some kind of costume party.

- Was Cam the Indian?

- No. For your information, Dad,

- we were actually doing a little construction at the house.

- What'd you build? 

- A gift-wrapping station.

- And we're back. 

-  So, thank you for that. - You're welcome.

- Hey, uh, Dad, do you remember when I was, probably 11...

- and you were teaching me how to fight, and then I quit?

- Yeah, when you said everything you needed to learn 

- you'd learn from West Side Story.

-  Yeah. - How'd that work out for you?

- If I'm ever in a dance fight, I'll let you know.

- So, yeah- Is the offer, uh, still good?

- Why? What's the matter? You got problems with Cam?

- No! Why would you say that?

- Well, come on. I mean, you know, sharing a room with a guy?

- I bunked with my brother. I know that can get pretty rough.

- I don't "bunk" with Cam.

- Dad, I just wanna learn a little self-defense, you know.

- Show me what you remember.

-  Right now? - Yeah.

- Okay, uh- Gosh, uh- Thumbs out.

-  Thumbs. Attaboy. - And then

- That wasn't- That wasn't very pretty, was it?

- You know what? Maybe it was a little too pretty.

- That's the thing.

- Here it goes.

- Oh! Oh, man!

- Buddy! 

- Think the problem is, you're not jumping from high enough.

- You should get on top of the garage.

- Alex, stop trying to kill your brother.

- Listen, guys, I need your help.

- We've gotta find your dad one of those iPad thingies.

- So, Haley, text everyone you know.

- Alex? Facebook, chat, tweet, buzz, bling,

- I don't know! Just do what you have to do.

- We have got to find one of these iPads. Okay?

- Luke? Sweetie, that means stay out of everyone's way

- and stop inhaling the balloons.

- I'm not inhaling them.

- Stop lying.

- How did she know?

- Didn't your mama teach you never to take a ride from a stranger?

- Got a little vacation time coming up?

- Have fun on the moon!

- Not feeling too well lately?

- Maybe you should come see the doctor...

- and I'll get rid of it!

- What's that supposed to mean?

- Attention. If you're here for Phil's birthday party,

- they're gathering in the picnic area.

- Phil's birthday party.

- My wife knew I'd be here.

- She put together a whole party for me.

- Does that really make up for not getting an iPad?

- Don't make me sorry I shared that with you. Okay?

- See you, fellas.

- Howdy-do!

- I just heard the announcement for Phil's birthday party.

- Oh, yeah. It's right around the corner.

-  Awesome. - Have fun!

- Thank you. Thanks, my lady.

- Ice-cream cake? Ice-cream cake's good.

- Happy birthday, Phil!

- This is awesome!

-  Happy birthday! - Happy birthday!

- Happy birthday, sweetie.

-  Happy birthday. - Have a really good birthday.

-  Did you see the cake? - Oh, yeah. It's great.

- Hello?

- No, that's fine, I'm just putting the baby down.

- Okay, that's Jake. He's the one that's having an affair.

-  I know. - Yeah, I can do it tomorrow night.

- I'll just give my wife some excuse.

- Men are pigs.

-  I don't really have a choice, do I? - Yeah.

- You could not cheat on her! How about that?

- Because it has to be a surprise.

- When she hears me speaking Italian to her grandmother,

- it'll be worth all this sneaking around.

- Lily, I had it backwards. He's wonderful.

- Don't worry. I'll just tell her I'm working late.

- No, Jake, don't do that.

- That's the worst thing you could do.

- Buonanotte.

- Oh, no, Lily, what are we gonna do?

- We have to fix this.

- Okay, Mitchell, I'm gonna teach you

- a couple of basic Brazilian jiu-jitsu moves.

- Now, just attack me.

- I'm sorry- What?

- Take any deep-seated anger you may have,

- get a running start and come at me.

- Dad, I don't have any deep-seated anger.

- Remember that Halloween when 

- I wouldn't let you go as Olivia Newton-John?

- You see what I did? I used your momentum against you.

- I learned this choke from the Gracie brothers.

- It's called the lion killer- mata lella.

-  Okay. - Now try to get out. Try to get out.

-  See? - I can't.

- Yeah, all right. Now

-  Passing out... - See, the beauty of this is,

- you don't have to make the first move.

- You know, chances are your opponent's gonna be overconfident.

- He's gonna think you don't know anything.

- Basically, he's being suckered into thinking

- Manny. Manny, that little bastard, he hustled me.

- Oh, crap.

- Ah, crap. Mitchell!

- Oh, crap. All right. Come on. Breathe.

- Attaboy. You all right? Coming around.

-  Why am I on the floor?-  Come on, Mitchell.

- Haley, I just struck out again.

- Please tell me you have some good news.

- Okay, so The Grove just got a new shipment.

- I'm texting you the directions now.

- Oh! Okay, that's good. That's good. That's good.

- I'm there. I'm on that.

- That kid stole my watch.

-  Huh? - What?

- He hustled me at chess.

- I thought you promised you were gonna let him win.

-  I did the first time. - Wait a minute. You're in on it too?

- Manny, go and get dressed for the party.

- Do I have time for a steam?

-  Yeah, but a quick one. - Okay.

- Why tell him to lose to me?

- Because you're like a baby when you don't win.

- With the kicking and the eyebrows...

- and the angry eating of the sunflower seeds.

- Actually, that's not true.

- I don't mind losing to a chess genius, which Manny obviously is.

- Chess genius? He's not even as good as I am.

- You're not that good in chess.

-  I beat you on our honeymoon. - Or did I let you win?

- You didn't let me win.

- Why would I sacrifice my queen for your pawn, Jay?

- Stop saying that.

- Luke, honey, hi. What's going on?

- They guy came with Dad's cake,

- but just so you know, it's missing a piece.

-  Luke, did you take a bite out of your father's cake? - No.

-  Stop lying, Luke. - I'm not lying.

- By the way, I used your credit card to pay him.

- Is that all right?

- Oh, no, that's fine. 

- Whatever. That's why I left the wallet there.

- Oh, my God.

- Oh, my God!

- I left the wallet there! I left the wa- 

- Your poor father.

- All this running around,

- and he's gonna think nobody cares about him on his birthday.

- More cake?

- Why not, Little Phil?

- I got no place else to go.

- Sir! Sir! Sir, hi. Excuse me.

- Um, yes. I know this is highly unusual,

- but I need your help to save a marriage.

- There is a couple in this neighborhood...

- that is about to get a divorce for a simple misunderstanding.

- Their name is Jake and Debbie.

- And I know you've taken an oath...

- to not tell people where other people live, 

- and I respect that,

- but maybe we could work out some sort of

- super secretive spy signal,

- where if you scratch your left ear,

- you know, maybe they live on the left,

- and if you scratch your right ear, they live on

- They live right here.

- This conversation never happened.

-  Sorry. - Oh, thank God!

- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

- Dad just put me to sleep.

- The hunting story.

- Hmm. No.

- Oh, my gosh, no. You can't cut the line. Sorry.

-  I was here. - Uh-uh.

- I-I've been here for an hour and a half

- and you haven't been, so you cut the line.

-  Whatever. - Whoa. Excuse me, sir.

- I don't think you understand.

- You're not getting in front of us.

- Calm down, gingerbread.

-  Are you gonna move or not? - No.

- Oh, no.

- Then you leave me no choice.

- Oh, my God.

- Go to sleep.

- Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

- No.

-  Mitchell, what are you doing? Get off of him. - Shut up.

-  He's about to go to sleep. - No, I'm not.

- Okay, folks. Break this up. You three- out of line.

- Oh, no. I'm sorry, sir. I didn't have anything to do with this.

- I'm just waiting in line to get an iPad.

- I don't even know this guy.

- Oh, my God. I need your credit card.

-  He's the problem. - Shut up! You're supposed to be asleep.

-  It's okay. I have it. - Get off!

-  I've got it. - What?

- I've got your card. I'm good. No, I'm good.

- I'm good. I'm here. I'm here!

- I've gotta get my husband an iPad!

- Key to a good birthday? Low expectations.

- Thought I was getting an iPad. I was wrong about that.

- Thought I was getting a surprise party at the batting cages.

- Sorry, Big Phil.

- Guess when it comes right down to it,

- we're all just Jeff Sweeney taking a fastball to the plums.

- Hey, um, Dad, your cake fell off the counter,

- but Uncle Cam's trying to fix it.

- He won't.

- And the pizzas never showed up.

- And they won't!

- Hey, balloons.

- Fine. I guess we'll never know.

- Or we can find out right now.

- Yeah, Manny, give me the chess set.

-  Oh, it's a chess set. - Yeah. You'll get it later.

- We got something to settle now.

-  Go in there. - Happy birthday, Phil.

- Happy happy.

- Is that Claire's baked brie I smell?

- No.

- Oh, Cam, Cam, you'll never believe what happened.

-  Happy birthday, Phil! - Sure!

- You'll never believe what happened.

- I got in trouble for fighting.

- And we saved a marriage.

-  Well, this is the best day ever. - It really is.

- Ain't it though?

- Look at this, papi, huh?

- Easy.

- You can't sing "We Are the Champions"...

- without your queen.

- Damn it! Listen, I lose and I burn this house down!

-  Ah, but look at this... - Honey, honey.

- What are we doing? This is ridiculous.

- One of us is gonna win the game,

- the other's gonna feel lousy, and we both lose.

- Yeah, just leave my birthday present on the floor.

- That's my girl. She had me.

- There was no way I could win. I knew it.

- I'm just glad she didn't know it yet.

- Two moves, and then

- I'm a very good chess player.

- But I'm a better wife.

-  Hey, did you get it? - No.

-  How's your dad? - Acting weird... er.

-  Hey, wife. - Honey, hi.

-  Um, listen... - Mom.

- Yeah, Luke, hang on one second.

- Honey, it's okay. I don't feel things anymore.

-  But, sweetie, I want you to feel... - Mom!

- Luke, I'll be with you in just a second. Where are you going?

- Just heading out to the yard to get a shovel for my cake.

-  Mom. - Luke, what do you want?

- I went on Dad's computer,

- contacted some of his geek friends,

- told them that he was dying 

- and his last wish was an iPad.

- Luke, what have I told you about

- One of them felt so bad, they brought over an extra.

- Oh, my God. You got it. You beautiful little liar!

- Here comes Dad.

- Who wants some cake?

- I used to, but I don't desire food any

- Oh, my God. You got it!

- All this time I said I didn't care,

- but I do care. I care so much!

-  Do you want to blow out the candles? - Yes.

- Go on. Go.

- It did not just do that!

-  Yes, it did! - Honey!

- Oh, who's ready for the first day of the rest of their lives?

-  Phil, happy birthday! - Look at this!

-  Can I touch it? - Yeah, not so hard, but touch it.

- Touch it, but don't touch it. Touch it, but don't touch it.

- I'm so sorry I ever doubted you.

- I love you. 

- Thank God that guy came over.

- What did he say his name was?

- He didn't. Must be an angel.

- Did you hear that? I'm an angel.

-  Or some creepy perv. - Yeah.

- How did he know? Eww. 

-  Maybe I should call the police. - You should call the police.

-  I'm gonna call the police. - And they lived happily ever after.

- No, Cam. Where are you going? It was just getting good.

- I want- That's my program.

- I love you.

-  I love you too, honey. - Oh. Okay.

S01E20 
----------------------
- Steaks will be ready in five minutes.

- You're destroying those things.

-  Ay, Jay, leave him alone.  - No, I'm sorry,

- but that cow has suffered long enough.

-  Fun. - Wait.

- Hang on. Dinner's ready in five minutes.

- Coach wants us to practice layups.

- They are deceptively hard- a curious mix of dance and strength.

-  You're making it lame again. - Sorry.

-  Ay, Dios mio, that coach. - Oh, I hate that guy.

- He seems to have the kids motivated.

- Oh, Dad, you haven't seen him. 

- He taunts the kids. He's abusive.

- Listen, if this was a Colombian soccer league, long time ago,

- one of the kids would have taken that guy out and

- A coach is supposed to ride the kids hard.

-  Phil, help me out here. - He's a mean man.

- Oh, you're such a woman.  - Come to the game. You'll see.

- This guy's a real motherscratcher.

- Pardon the language, Gloria.

- "Gloria"?

- He better cool it, 

- or I'm gonna introduce him to the Captain and Tennille.

- Sorry we're late. I was at work.

-  Oh, he loves to say that. - And happy barbecue.

- Oh. Since Mitchell is between jobs,

- I've taken a part-time job at a greeting card store,

- which I love.

- Plus, with my discount, 

- we're saving a fortune.

- How is spending a ton of money on greeting cards saving us a fortune?

- It's math.

- It's really not. Look it up.

- 2.95. 2.95. 4.95.

-  Forty percent off.  - 2.95.

- 3.95.  - Forty percent off. Forty percent off.

- Mitchell, I got this golf buddy of mine.

- Great guy. Super successful. You two should talk.

- It could mean a job for you.

- Oh, thanks, Dad, but I'm

- I'm not really looking for anything right now.

-  But-  - Yeah, that's right.

- With me bringing home the bacon,

- Mitchell doesn't have to rush into anything.

- Yeah, I know you have all that greeting card "Screw you" Money,

- but, uh, talk to the guy?

- He's expecting your call in the morning.

- Dad, I appreciate it, but in the future- I can't stand this.

- I am sorry, but I

- No. Those steaks have been done for five minutes.

- I'm taking 'em off the grill.

- I'm sorry. I know how it feels

- to have him stick his nose where it doesn't belong.

- No biggie. It's just Jay being Jay.

- But one day I'm gonna be a grandfather,

- and then everybody better hide their meat.

- Ooh. Who's she?

- I hate it when you do that.

-  Who's he? - It's Charlie Bingham.

- He's the guy that my dad wanted me to call.

-  I googled him. Look.

- Oh, he owns Earthgear Apparel. 

- I have their ski pants.

- Really? You don't- You don't ski.

- I have cargo pants and I don't work at the docks.

- God, I feel like such a slacker.

- I mean, he has done so much for being so young.

- Okay, look. He's opened up a dozen

- environmental foundations and conservancies.

-  Wow.  - So, you gonna- you gonna call him?

- I don't know. I mean, you know,

- I sort of promised myself and you...

- that I'd take a little time off, and

-  And you are loving your time off.  - Totally.

- I am losing my mind.

- As much as I love Lily

- which is, you know, more than life itself

- I am- whoo- not cut out to be a stay-at-home dad.

- No, but it's Cameron's turn.

- It's Cameron's turn to be out in the world...

- interacting with other grown-ups while I get to stay at home...

- and-and plot the death of Dora the Explorer.

- Like to fill her backpack with bricks 

- and throw her into Candy Cane River.

- So, I don't know. Should I- Should I call him?

- I don't know. Maybe just to get your dad off your back.

-  Yeah. Yeah. - I mean,

- because the last thing I want for you is to take a job right now.

- I am loving our life.

- I am in a really dark space.

- Being away from my Lily is literally torture.

- And I can't pressure Mitchell,

- but I really, really, really just want him to get a job...

- so I can go back to being a stay-at-home dad/trophy wife!

- Guys, come on!

- Come on, ladies! Move it! 

- Goodness gracious! Turtles run faster!

- Come on!

- Could you run any slower?

- I dare you to run slower!

-  You see?  - He's just trying to light a fire.

- Oh, I'll light him on fire!

- Why do I always have to come to these things?

- Because you love your brother.

- Why don't you make him come to my orchestra concerts?

- Because we love your brother. Good job, Luke.

- Shoot!

- Delgado, you're killing me, man!

- I love you, Manny, no matter what!

- Come on!

- Okay. That's great.

- Okay, well, I'll let you know. Right.

- All right. Bye.

- Uh, so, Charlie Bingham just invited us over...

- to his beach house for a little get-together.

- Oh. Uh, what did you say?

- I said I'd check with you. 

- I mean, what do you think?

- What do you think?

- Well, I think it'd be rude not to hear him out.

-  Yeah. I mean, yeah. You're probably right.  - Yeah.

-  Okay. - Cool.

- And don't worry. You know, I'm not gonna take any job.

- You better not.

- I just miss

- I just

- I just- 

- I just miss...  my grilled cheese sandwiches!

- You're doing great, Luke- 

- if your goal is to suck!

-  Phil, you-  - I'm on it.

-  Okay.  - Wait for me.

-  Hey, Coach. - Yeah?

- Uh, look. We appreciate your passion,

- but some of us are worried that

- the yelling is getting counterproductive.

- I got this. Come on, stupid!

- No, you don't "Got this." What you got is a bad attitude.

- Who are you?

- I happen to be the stepfather of

- Doesn't matter who. What you need to start doing...

- is a little more coaching and a little less yelling.

- 'Cause if I hear you call one of these kids stupid again,

- I swear to God, I'll throw a shoe at your head.

- Screw it. I don't need this.

- You think you can do a better job?

- You coach.

- Jay, you know, I was handling it.

- Yeah, I saw how you broke out Peaches and Herb.

- It's the Captain and

- Okay. So, your old coach had to leave for a little while.

- Why? Is he sick?

-  Yes. He's very, very sick.  - Is he going to die?

- Everybody dies, boys. Let's focus on what's important.

- Our next game is in one hour.

- We are going to go from being five fingers to being a fist.

-  How does that sound?  - Great.

-  I can't hear you.  - Great!

- That's what I'm talkin' 'bout!

- All right, gentlemen. I talked to the referee. I'm coaching.

-  Oh, really? 'Cause I-  - Phil, I coached football.

- Jay, I actually coached basketball. 

- I think I can get these guys

- Relax. You've already got the assistant job.

- Now you think you can round us up some waters?

-  Yeah.  - Go ahead.

- Gentlemen, this is what I need.

- I want you to hit 'em, and I want you to hit 'em hard.

- Father-in-laws are tough,

- because you can't let 'em push you around...

- and you also have to show them respect.

- It's like walking a tightrope.

- Which, by the way, I can do, because I went to trapeze school.

- Did Jay? I doubt it.

- All right, when you back into- 

- Honey, I'm gonna take off.

-  I'm gonna buy Alex some clothes.  - Okeydoke.

- How come you're not coaching?

- 'Cause your dad coached football.

- I'm sorry. 

- And I am going to make it up to you tonight.

-  And I'll be thinking of your dad while you do.  - Mmm.

- Disturbing.

-  Hey, Phil.  - Hey.

- How's it going?

- Ay. Great. Your dad coached football.

- Ah. A fellow victim.

- Thank you again for taking care of Lily. I know it's last-minute.

- Ay. Don't be silly.

- We'll probably just stick around for a few minutes.

- You know how fussy she gets when we pass her off, so

-  Oh. She seems fine.  - Yeah.

- Ay. I think she's getting used to

- being away from you now that you have the new job.

- Mwah! So proud of you.

-  We need to talk.  - Okay. What happened?

- Mom, I love you,

- but your words of encouragement

- encourage the other kids to make fun of me.

- Ay. Okay.

- I won't say anything else on the next game. Promise.

- We both know that your Latin blood makes that impossible.

- I think it would be better if you didn't come to the next game.

- I know.

-  I hate our house.  - I know.

- What's- What's this thing?

- I don't know, but it's fancy.

- Stop- Stop playing with it. Come on. 

- Just- Don't break it.

-  Hey, Mitchell!  - Yes.

-  Charlie Bingham.  - Nice to meet you.

-  Hi.  - This is my partner, Cameron Tucker.

-  Pleasure.  - Cameron.

- So, we just went ahead and

- parked on that round thingy in the driveway.

-  Is that- That's fine, right?  - No problem.

- It's a turntable, so you don't have to back out.

- You have a car turntable and you're wearing rubber.

- You're like Batman.

- I really am.

- Come on in.

- Turn the music down!

- Pardon the get-up.

- Killer waves today. You guys surf?

- Um, only for bargains on the Web.  

- Everybody say hi.

-  Hi.  - Hello.

- Hi.  - That's Jolie. 

- She's head of my Europe division.

- She cheats at poker. You do.

- And that's my girlfriend, Jenny.

- She makes a hell of a margarita. Want one?

-  Absolutely.  - Oh, not right- Okay.

- Everybody, Mitchell Pritchett and his partner, Cameron.

- Business partners. Mergers and acquisitions.

-  I'm kidding. We're gay.  - Stop talking.

- When things are relaxed, I'm great in social situations.

- I would have fit in at the Algonquin Round Table.

- But when the stakes are high, I get a little tense.

- I'd be the guy that would knock over the round table.

- Then Dorothy Parker would make a quip, 

- James Thurber would laugh,

- and then I would end up leaving, crying.

-  How long you been on the lam?  - What?

- Honey, you are looking around like the feds are after you.

- No, I'm not. Let's just get this over with.

- Oh. All right. 

- Oh, no. It's them.

- Oh! Oh, you know those girls from school.

-  Hey!  - Let's go! Over here.

-  What- What is your problem?  - Nothing.

- I'll meet you at the car in an hour.

- Please, Mom. Please.

-  Hi, Jenna.  - Hi.

- And just like that- my baby girl became a teenager.

- She entered that dreaded phase 

- where my very existence embarrasses her.

- I-I think I can help.

- You're not your mom.

- Wow. That's your mom.

- Oh, I just got chills.

- So, first off, I'm a fan.

-  Saw you in court once.  - Seriously?

- Yeah. Mayhew versus Propyltech.

-  You are a good lawyer.  - I don't know.

- If you'd handled my divorce, 

- this house would be twice as big.

- Oh, he's better than good. Try winning an argument with him.

-  Last night I wanted to have Indian food-  - And we're talking again.

- Top of your class at Cornell and Columbia Law.

- Had your pick of jobs,

- but instead chose to work in environmental law- until last month.

- Well- And he used to be a really great figure skater.

-  Why'd you quit?  - His sister lost interest,

-  and then there was- - He means my job.

- Could tell me about figure skating too.

- Um, well, it was- She did lose interest.

-  That's enough.  - Okay.

- Ay, que linda. Ay, que linda.

- Oh, my gosh. I didn't know you guys were gonna be here.

- Hola, Claire.

- Hi, Lily.

- I had enough basketball for one day.

- Oh, I know. Come here, sweetie.

- Oh, sweet thing. You love me and you want me to buy you a dress.

- Ay. But I'm gonna buy her some shoes first. Mmm.

- What's that, Lily? Do you want me to buy you a dress?

- She said "Yes."

- "Yes"?

- She did not say "Yes."

- Okay, "Win" On three.

- One, two, three- Win!

- Don't forget the pick and roll.

-  These guys won't know how to defend it.  - Phil,

-  try not to confuse my boys, okay?  - Okay.

-  I sleep with your daughter.  - What?

- Good luck!

- All right. Let's go! Let's go! Come on. Let's go!

- Let's get out there. Hustle up. Get the tip, get the tip.

- Watch, skip and go. 

- Oh! All right. Keep the hustle, keep the hustle.

- Come on, boys. Don't let 'em push you around.

- Oh! All right, little defense!

- Play defense!

- I did a little scouting,

- and the other team only has two shooters.

- If we isolate both of them-  

- Good, Phil, good. Thank you. Good.

- Manny, pay attention! What are you looking at?

- What?

- And that was in 2004.

- So, tell me this.

- What are the regulatory challenges of a solar farm?

- Uh, well, you know, it could be anything- uh, agricultural

- Military, protected species,

- ironically, even some, uh, environmental groups.

- I think you got all of it.

- Think you got it.

- Yeah. I'm just gonna freshen this up.

-  Let me ask you a question.  - Yeah.

- How do you like the beard?

- I'm thinking of growing one. Jenny's against it.

- Oh. Well, I-I've been very happy with mine.

- That's it. I'm doin' it.

- Look, I've made a fortune. I want to use it for some good.

- I need a lawyer to help me navigate.

- I like you. You get me. So, in or out?

- I just

-  I'm very sorry.  - It's okay.

- Um, that's a very big question.

- You know, I'm obviously gonna have to 

- go talk to my- bull in a china shop.

-  I'll be right back.  - Sure.

- Talk it over. It's a major life decision.

- Hey, Jenny! The beard is on!

- Okay, Lily, it's time to buy you beautiful shoes.

- Oh, no, no, no. I saw another really cute dress for her.

- Ay. But she has already six new dresses.

- What she needs is strappy shoes.

- There's Alex. I'll-I'll see you later.

- Alex, honey. Hi.

- Mom, I said I'd meet you at the car.

- Here.

- Thank you.

- Still wish you had a daughter?

-  Manny didn't want me at the game today.  - Oh, I'm sorry.

-  It's okay.  - No, it's not okay. It sucks.

- I miss babies. They never tell you to go away.

- Yeah. Or wait in the car.

- I don't know about you,

- but I'm not gonna stand here and feel sorry for myself.

- You know what we should do?

- Get pregnant.

- I was gonna say go for ice cream.

- Okay. We'll do yours first. Great.

- Luke! Luke!

- It's hard to guard a player if there's no player near you!

- We good in the hood?

- This is a uniquely frustrating group of boys.

- I hear you. Um, one thing that might help- instead of a zone,

- if you switch to a simple man-to-man.

-  I got this.  - Really?

- 'Cause according to the scoreboard,

- the only thing you got is four points.

- Good luck.

-  I need to talk to you.  - I need to talk to you.

- Nice top.

- Come here. You- You

- Cam- Cam, you have got to relax.

- I told you I wouldn't take a job without

-  Take the job.  - What?

- I want you to take the job.

- I thought you liked having me home with Lily. I

- I don't. I mean, I do. I just- 

- I miss my time with Lily,

- and I know it's selfish of me, but

-  No, I want the job.   - You do?

- Oh, my God, yes. 

- I- I love Lily, but I hate baby talk.

- I love baby talk.

-  Let's go get this job.  - Let's get this job.

-  Okay.  - Oh, no.

- It's locked.

- Well, just

- Hello? Hey, guys?

- Oh, my gosh.

- They're not gonna hear us. We're trapped out here.

- Just stop being so dramatic.

- We'll just go through the garage, with the

- That's why he wants to hire you. You're good in crisis.

- Ooh, yeesh. What

-  It's not opening.  - Push it again.

-  I'm hearing things, but it's not-   - Push it harder.

- That's not- Is it this one?

- I hear something. What is that?

- No. Stop touching- Stop

- This- Oh, that was it. All right.

-  Mitchell! Oh, my God. Did-   - No!

-  Oh, my God!   - No, Cam!

- Cam, we- Did we do that? 

- What are we gonna say?

- I will take the job.

-  Kinda think you have to now.  - Yeah.

- Guys, you're on the same team!

- Time out!

-  Time out! - Get over here!

- Guys, earlier we practiced a few set plays.

- Did any of them involve wrestling the ball from your own teammate?

-  But you said to be aggressive.  - Yeah!

- Not on your own team! Wait here.

- You gotta coach. I can't take it.

-  You talkin' to me?   - Yeah, I'm talkin' to you.

- You gotta take over. I'm about to lose it out there.

- That sounds tough, Coach.

-  What's your problem? - Hey, Coach! Ticktock.

- I was dealing with the coach. You pushed me aside.

- I was dealing with the boys. You pushed me aside.

- Believe it or not, Jay,

- there are some things that I am better at than you are.

-  Bam! It's out there.   - Oh, for God's sake.

-  Coach!   - He's calling you.

- Listen. I don't blame you for being angry. All right?

- I'm used to taking charge. That's all.

- I should have let you coach from the get-go.

- And?

-  I love you.  - No. The barbecue.

- Oh, for God's sake.

- I'm sure your steaks would have been delicious... and not chewy.

-  Okay. I'll do it.  - Thanks.

- And so the student becomes the master.

-  The once mighty- - You know what? Forget it. 

- No, no, no, no. I'm good. I'm good.

- Hey, hey. Guys. Who wants to go out like a champ?

-  Yeah!  - Me!

- I love it! Okay, Jordy, you inbound to Luke.

- Manny, you set a pick on Luke's man 

- and roll to the bucket.

-  Luke, you know what to do.  - No, I don't.

-  Bounce-pass to Manny.  - But, Dad

- Coach, Manny hasn't taken a single shot all season.

- Then chances are he'll be open.

- Okay, guys. Let's bring it out.

- Hey, hey. Bring it in.

- Let's show these guys what kind of team they're about to beat.

- Huh? "Li'I Dribblers" On three.

- One, two, three- Li'I Dribblers!

- Okay, red ball. Side out. Here we go.

- What's my coaching philosophy?

-  Give a kid a bird-  - Yes!

- And he becomes one of those weird dudes 

- who walks around with a bird on his shoulder.

- But give him a pair of wings,

- he can fly.

- Unless he has absolutely no hand-eye coordination.

- Okay, I support you.

- Mom.

- That was 20 minutes.

- Mom, I am so, so sorry.

- I know it's no excuse,

- but I've been feeling a lot of pressure at school.

- You know, with friends.

- And I love you so much,

- and I appreciate everything you do for me.

- I'm still your little girl.

- Oh, honey! That was so sweet.

- Can I get $20? A bunch of us are going to a movie,

- and we're gonna get something to eat afterwards.

- Jenna's brother's gonna take us home.

- Okay. Of course. Sweetie, you know what? Take 40.

-  Oh, my gosh.  - Yeah. That's right.

-  Thanks, Mom.  - Go on. Have a great time.

- Oh, Alex, honey? When you're out shopping,

- you might wanna pick yourself up a training bra.

- I know you don't need one now,

- but your little boobies are gonna come in soon.

- Mommy loves you, kitten!

- Mwah! Mwah!

- Teach her to screw with me.

- I set a pick and then rolled towards the basket.

- Luke passed to me. I shot the ball and almost made it.

- I bought Lily the cutest little dress today.

- And then I stole the ball from the other team,

- did a 360 and almost dunked it.

- That's nice. 

- Ay. I just had the best day today with Lily.

- That girl's so sweet.

- I have a game next Saturday. You could come.

- No, it's okay. I wouldn't want to embarrass you.

- I'll probably take Lily out for cupcakes. Mm-hmm.

- Okay.

- Any suggestions?

- I usually go with earrings.

S01E21 
----------------------
- Honeydew! What's up?

- Guess who's here.

- Your dad!

- He drove his R.V. all the way up from Cocoa Beach.

- Hey, Son, working hard?

- He's gonna say "Hardly working."

- I meant to tell you he was driving out.

-  Did he say it? - Oh, yeah.

- Good kid.

- He wasn't supposed to show up for a few more days.

- Well, guess what he brought us.

- A dog... to keep.

- Yes! Yes.

- Yes, I should have told Claire about the dog,

- and I was going to.

- But I was just waiting for her to be in the right mood.

- Actually, I did get one right mood a couple nights ago,

- but I cashed that in for something else.

-  Am I in trouble? - Oh, really, really big.

- Okay, I'm a little scared. How bad is this?

- Oh, well we have a new rule- no sleeping in the bedroom.

- Mr. Pritchett. Uh, Ben- Ben Dugan.

- I went to high school with Mitch.

- We were in the drama club together.

-  That's right. - Yeah.

- Geez, I didn't recognize you

- without that old-guy makeup on.

- You know, you and Mitch knocked The Sunshine Boys out of the park.

- Mitch was really great in that.

- I always thought he should be an actor.

- Yeah, he's got a real job now.

- He's a lawyer. How about you?

-  Still acting. - Fantastic.

- Actually, it's exciting. I'm in a new movie,

- Maple Drive. Just came out.

- You're kidding me. Look at me. I know somebody famous.

- Uh, anyway, I got to go.

-  Great to see you. - Good to see you too.

- Kid's a movie star.

-  Hey, how'd it go in there? - No cavities.

- And I got a free toothbrush.

- Hey, you want to go to the movies?

- I just heard about a good one.

- But I'm supposed to be in school.

- Well, you're supposed to floss too,

- but you got away with that one.

- Come on. Let's go.

- One of the greatest days of my life...

- was when my old man sprung me from school

- and took me to the track.

- I wanted to do the same type of thing for Manny,

- plus I figured when Gloria heard about it,

- maybe it pays off in the bedroom.

- I wonder if that's why my old man did it.

- Oh, crap.

- Your mother-in-law just had to have the dog.

- Turns out she's allergic.

- And the pet store didn't have a grace period

- or a return policy or anything?

- I got him from the pound.

- Was there a twister in Kansas?

- 'Cause there's a house in my driveway.

- Welcome home, Mr. Dunphy.

- Uh, always a pleasure, Mr. Dunphy.

- Indeed it is, Mr. Dunphy. Place it there.

-  Oh, I shall. I shall. - I miss this. Get in here.

- My dad is awesome.

- He's awesome. He's always up. He's always happy.

- I mean, he and I are best buds.

- We're like two peas in a pod.

- Or Siamese twins. Or a snake with two heads.

-  They've actually been all those things for Halloween. - Yeah.

- Oy. This must be Scout, huh?

- I should warn you. He sheds.

- I made the mistake of letting him sleep with me on the road.

- Now my sheets look like two bigfoots did it.

- Pardon the language.

-  How's Mom? - Speaking of big feet, eh?

- She's on a cruise with her girlfriends,

- some of which are not totally unattractive.

- Oh, that reminds me. She sent some gifts for the kids.

- Um, I will be right back.

-  You three get better acquainted. - Will do!

-  Bye! - Will do!

- I cannot believe you got a dog without consulting me.

- This was a major family decision.

-  It was wrong. - Yeah.

- And I'm sorry.

- But we have talked about getting a dog for years,

- and you're the only one who wasn't into it.

- Because I knew that I would be the one taking care of it.

- That's not true.

- No, we will all help.

- This is a great chance to teach the kids responsibility.

- That is exactly what you said about Luke's paper route.

- Hello?

- Is anyone in there?

- Red's a good color on you.

- It's just a movie.

-  Oh, he's so cute. - Look at his little face.

- I always wanted a dog. Thanks, Grandpa.

- Okay, but remember, having a dog is a major responsibility.

- Everyone in the family has to pitch in.

-  Can do, Mrs. D. - Not you, Dylan.

- Oh, phew. 'Cause I got a lot on my plate right now.

- Hey, look who's here. Uncle Cam.

- Hey, we heard about the new addition

- and we had to come right over.

- Cameron, so good to see you again.

- Now that is a shirt.

- Oh, well, thank you, Frank. I get 'em online.

- I'll send you a link.

- Oh, well, at home, I smoke sausages.

- I'll send you a link.

- Classic.

-  And this must be Lily. - Oh, yes.

- She just couldn't wait to meet the new doggy.

- I think she's good right here.

- Let me get in there and get some of that doggyness.

-  Oh, there it is. - Haley.

-  There it is. - I gotta go.

-  What's wrong? - That was Brian. He just quit the band.

- What? Why?

- He's moving to Portland.

- His parents got back together.

-  Oh, that sucks. - I know.

- Now we're gonna have to cancel the gig tomorrow.

- Maybe you can find another drummer.

- No. I think it's too late for that now.

- I play drums.

- Well, I mean, I haven't played in a while, since Lily's come along,

- but if you're in a jam, I can jam.

- Well, I totally would, but I'm not sure

- we like the same sorts of music, you know?

- What, because I'm gay,

- I'm just gonna want to play show tunes?

- No, because you're old.

- Wow. That hurt more, Dylan.

- Give him a chance. It's better than canceling.

- You're right. I don't want to lose

- the deposit on that fog machine.

- Okay. Let's do it.

- I used to be a music teacher,

- but I gave that up as soon as Lily came along.

- Yes. Well, we just felt that it was really important...

- that one of us stayed hometo raise her, so

- Yeah, and that's not a judgmenton other people's choices.

- It's just that we happen to be a very traditional family.

- Yes, that's what the disabled lesbian shaman

- who blessed Lily's room said too.

- How you doin', buddy?

- All right, relax.

- Oh, geez.

- I am telling you, Phil, the man was crying.

- That is impossible.

- My dad is the happiest guy on earth.

- It probably just sounded like he was crying.

- Have you heard the noise he makes when he gets out of a chair?

- No. I know what I heard.

- I think this has something to do with your mom.

-  What? - Yeah, he came here alone. Think about it.

- She's on a cruise.

- Yeah, and they never take separate vacations, so

- No. No, if something was wrong,

- my dad would tell me about it.

- No, Phil, he wouldn't,

- because you guys never actually talk about anything.

- We talk all the time.

- He crank calls me at work, like, three times a week.

-  Crank calls don't count. - Counts for fun.

- No, honestly, I think that you should

- find out what's going on with your dad.

- It's going to be nothing.

- My dad isn't like your dad.

- There's nothing deep and dark inside.

- His hard candy shell is just hiding more candy.

- I think he wants to go out. Good boy.

-  Smart dog. - I hate to break it to you,

- but I think all dogs can do that.

- I'm gonna play outside.

- What happened?

- Okay.

- Should I just play a little something?

- Yeah. But, you know, if it doesn't work out,

- don't feel bad.

- Well, hopefully this is- this is like riding a bicycle,

- and it'll all come back to me.

- That's the loud one.

- So... here we go.

- Oh, silly me.

- I had the sticks in the wrong hands.

- Dude, you should label those sticks.

- Is that the alarm? Has our perimeter been breached?

- It's not the alarm. The doorbell won't stop ringing.

-  Maybe a demon is ringing it. - Not a demon.

- Who keeps ringing the doorbell?

-  We're pretty sure it's a demon. - Oh, yeah?

- There.

- If it were a demon, it would keep on ringing.

- Not if he's already inside. I'm getting a weapon.

- What were you thinking?

- Who takes a little boy to a horror movie?

- That's loco, Jay.

- This is no big deal. You want scary?

- When I was his age,

-  I lived through the Cuban Missile Crisis.

- I slept with a butter knife under my pillow...

- in case I had to fight some Soviet colonel.

- Why would they send a Soviet colonel to get a little boy?

- Because I could identify every commie plane.

- What are we talking about?

- Look, all I'm saying, being scared is part of growing up.

- Manny will get over this. It builds character.

- I'll take the first watch.

- You two might as well get some rest.

- It's gonna be a long night.

- Character.

- Dad?

- Come on in! It's open!

- Don't tell me. You need a cup of sugar.

- Nah. Just, uh

- I was just wondering, I don't know, uh

- Anything on the old noodle?

- Other than a bad toupee?

- I'm kidding, of course. This is my real hair.

-  Well, okay. - Wait a minute.

- I want to ask you something.

- Am I putting you in a bad position with this whole dog thing?

- Claire seemed a little put out.

- Oh, don't worry about it. Claire didn't like me at first either.

- I can't blame her. Dismissed!

- Oh, Dad, um, you know what? I, uh

- Claire saw something,

- and she'd kill me if I- if I didn't ask.

- What is it?

- Would you wear pants to breakfast, for crying out loud?

-  You got me again. Right in the funny bone. - All right.

- Come on, Scout. Let go of it.

- No, no, no!

- Dog. Look at this.

- How did he get ahold of your bra?

- Well, uh, we were out on a date,

- and he has a really nice car, so

- How do you think? He got it out of the laundry basket.

- Can't take my eyes off that dog for a second.

- Why don't you just keep him in the crate?

- I tried that. He figured out how to get out.

- I thought you were dealing with your dad.

- Oh, yeah, I did. He's fine, so

- You got that from a two-minute conversation?

- I... asked him point-blank if he was okay.

- He said he was. So I just

- Just swapped some jokes and moved on.

- Phil, the man needs more of a push than that.

- Look, if he wants to talk to me about it, he will.

- Geez, someone's panties are in a bunch.

-  I thought I was showing concern and- - No. Right there.

- Oh, my God! That damn dog!

- Guys, little help?

- I have to go to the bathroom, and I'm not gonna do it in here.

-  Hey, I got Chinese. - Sweet! I'm starving.

- Oh, we have guests.

- Yeah. We're just having a little jam session.

- You know Dylan. This is Craig. This is Neil.

- I'll always remember him as the stranger holding my baby.

- Can I talk to you in the kitchen for a second?

- Yeah. Hey, guys, let's, uh- let's just take five.

- What's up with 21 Jump Street?

- Oh, well, their drummer quit

- and I'm gonna fill in for him tomorrow night.

- No, no. We have Pepper's

- apres-ski fondue party tomorrow night, Cam.

- Oh, no.

- So you'll just have to tell your band

- that they're gonna have to find someone else.

- You know what? No. I'm not gonna let these fellas down.

- I made a commitment.

- You made two commitments, okay?

- And you know how Pepper is.

- Everything has to be perfect.

- He gets mad if you don't wear a big sweater.

- Yeah, I remember. I got so hot last year,

- I almost went face down in the gruyere.

- So I'm going by myself, is that what you're saying?

- I just feel like I kind of need this.

- To round out your college applications?

- It's just that because I'm always home with Lily...

- I just feel like I'm going a little bit stir-crazy.

- Look at the den.

- Every time I finish painting it, I start all over again.

- It's like the Golden Gate Bridge.

- I'm gonna go back to jamming.

- Yeah, we gotta fix this.

- Hey, what's with the big sweater at a concert?

- Is that a gay thing?

- No, Dad. It's for my friend Pepper's apres-ski fondue

- Yeah. Yeah, it's a gay thing.

- Hope they start soon.

- I don't think Scout likes to be left alone.

- You love the dog.

- No, I don't love the dog. I love my couch.

- And the dog was looking at it like it was a giant sausage.

- Good news, you two. You're getting your driveway back.

-  I'm hitting the open road in the morning. - Oh, already?

-  Yeah. - Anxious to get home and see Mom, huh?

- No, I'm just gonna drive wherever the wind blows me,

- which is usually into the next lane.

- Can we get some sodas, Grandpa?

- Okay, but just one. I'm driving. Come on.

- He's not going home? He's never been away from my mom

- for longer than a doctor's appointment.

- Honey, I know. I told you.

- I always felt bad for people

- with emotionally distant fathers.

- It turns out I'm one of 'em.

- It's a miracle I didn't end up a stripper.

- Thanks, everybody, for coming out.

- These are some songs we wrote.

- One, two. One, two, three.

- * Baby, don't leave me I just want you to know *

- * I want you to know *

- * There's something inside me that I cannot control *

- * I cannot control *

-  Our boyfriends totally rock! - I know, right?

- * I heard you screamin' my name I'm goin' insane *

- Well, the plan was...

- to watch him for 10 minutes

- and then run out to Pepper's party.

- * Coursing through my veins *

- But he was so great up there.

- How-How could I leave?

- * But don't be afraid *

- * I'll be your vampire *

- It was his moment.

- I know!

- And his moment went on for a really, really long time.

- Turns out I could have run to the party

- and made it back for the end of his moment.

- Manny, go brush your teeth and get ready for bed, okay?

-  Your bed. - Can I watch TV?

-  Mmm, only 10 minutes. - Okay.

- Hey, Jay, it's Ben Dugan.

- I got your message.

- Uh, yes, I'm happy to help out. I'll swing by tonight.

-  What's that? - That's Ben.

- That's the guy who was in the movie.

- I figure when Manny sees him, sees how nice he is,

- he'll realize it's all pretend.

-  You think that will work? - Guy's a sweetheart.

- Manny's gonna spend two minutes with him.

- He'll explain how the movie's made.

- He's even bringing his fake machete.

- Thing's made of rubber.

- Hey, are you Manny? I'm here for you.

- Look what I got.

- Mom, he's here!

- Que paso? Que paso? Que paso?

- We're gonna need a bigger bed!

- Oh, geez.

- Oh, my God! I think that's him.

-  You stayed. - Yeah.

- Well, you know, I'm-I'm with the band.

- I thought the gig was a little sloppy in spots,

- but I think once I learn all the songs

- I thought- I thought this was a one-time thing?

- Are you kidding? We destroyed in there.

- Did you hear that one lady screaming my name?

- That was Phil. He had a Red Bull.

- Hey, guys. Good gig, huh?

-  Yeah. Totally awesome, man. - Heck of a gig.

- Hey, guys.

- Hey. I thought you were in Portland.

- No. My parents broke up again.

- I'm not moving. I can stay in the band.

- Well, this is awkward.

- Cam.

- Oh, awkward for me.

- Good luck following that, Ringo.

- I believe this belongs to you.

- I don't want to drag the house along with me.

- Come here, you little monkeys.

- Bye, Grandpa. We'll miss you.

- I wish I could take you with me.

-  Drive safe, Grandpa. - Oh, I'll try.

- You sure you don't want to stay for breakfast?

- No, I ought to be hitting the road.

- Well, adios.

- Dad, hold on.

-  Can I talk to you for a second? - Sure.

- Guys. Come on.

- I don't think you're being honest with me.

- I- I know something is going on with you.

- What's up?

- Something up? Well, my boxers are, uh, riding a little high.

- I'm not in the mood for jokes right now,

-  although you nailed that. - Thanks.

-  - Great stuff. - Thanks.

-  It's nothing. - Oh, it's nothing?

-  Nothing to do with Mom? - No!

- Well, yeah. I've fallen in love.

- Oh, my God.

-  Who is she? - He!

- What?

- It's that little guy right over there.

- Come on over here. Come on. Come on.

- There you go. Ah, look at him.

- Driving across country,

- this little bastard nuzzled his way

- right into my heart, didn't ya?

- So this is just about you not wanting to leave the dog?

- Well, you should tell Mom.

- Those three days on the road with him

- were the happiest of my life.

- You should leave that part out.

- I don't want to keep Scout if it makes Grandpa sad.

- Yeah, I know, sweetie. But Grandma has allergies,

- so Scout has to stay with us.

- Well, she could always just get some allergy shots.

- Honey, you don't want to put her through that.

- Hell, back in the day, I got a vasectomy for her.

- Dad. Dad. Please.

- Scout's- Scout's your dog.

- He should go with you.

- Okay, you twisted my arm.

- Thanks, Son. Thanks for poking through the armor.

-  You're poking through the armor down there. - What?

- Made you look.

- You are a treasure.

- Come on, Scout. Let's mosey.

- Oh, oh, oh! Oh, wait.

-  He loves that, yeah. - Oh, I bet he does.

- No, Scout. This time I drive.

- You still got it!

- I can't believe I'm saying this,

- but I think I might have actually gotten even closer with my dad.

- I can't believe he took my dog.

-  Bye-bye. - Bye, Grandpa! Love you!

- Bye, Dad.

-  Bye, Grandpa! I love you! - Luke, stay!

- Luke, stay! - Come back soon! I'll see you later!

- Luke, stay!

-  Luke! - Stay!

- Frank.

- Hey, Jay. Good to see you.

- Great to see you. Didn't expect to find you here.

- Well, listen, when my granddaughter's boyfriend's band

- plays an under-21 club with my daughter-in-law's

- brother's gay partner, I show up.

- That's just how I was raised.

-  I don't think you met my wife, Gloria. - Hola.

- Oh, it's a pleasure. You are a lovely woman.

-  You must be Frank.  - Okay, then,

- you are hotter than a Las Vegas sidewalk on the Fourth of July.

-  Did I go too far? - Not you, Frank. No.

S01E22 
----------------------
- Oh, I forgot to ask- Did it hurt?

- What hurt?

- When you fell from heaven and landed on earth.

- I didn't fall from- Ah.

- Because I'm an angel.

- Why are you so sweet?

- Maybe just 'cause I'm so damn happy.

- Today's Ja y's birthday,

- so I'm taking him to Hawaii for a whole week.

- Big suite in Maui. Just the two of us.

- Got Manny tied up in the backyard. Big bowl of kibble.

- I'm kidding. He's staying with Claire and Phil.

- This whole thing was a big surprise.

- I did it all myself- the flight, the hotels.

- Cost me a fortune, but it was worth it.

- In case I forget to say it a few hundred times this week,

- thank you.

- Happy birthday!

- Wh- What the heck?

-  Surprise, Dad. - The whole family's coming with us!

-  They are? - Uh-huh.

- Yes, and Mitch and Cameron and Lily too.

- Yeah, and Phil- he's just checking the bags. Wow!

- That's, uh- Wow.

- It was all Gloria's idea.

- She bought all of our tickets and everything.

-  Really? Everyone's? - Yeah.

- It's your birthday. I didn't spare any expense.

- Oh, gee! Thank you, honey.

- Are they, uh, all gonna be up with us in first class?

- Ay, no, silly. Coach. You think I'm made of money?

- Of course not.

- We're gonna go to a luau,

- swim with the Miami Dolphins,

- take a tour in one of those, the

-  Helicopter. Helicopter. - Mm-hmm. Yes!

- I don't like activities.

- I wanted to hang out with Gloria

- and read my Robert Ludlum novels.

- I got eight of 'em loaded up on my book reader thing here.

- I mean, I love my family.

- I love 'em at dinners, I love 'em at barbecues,

- but do I have to love 'em in Hawaii?

- Thanks, Daryl.

- I know I got a lot of baggage,

- but don't worry, I'm seeing a therapist.

- Just kidding. I'm fine.

- Daryl, I know these guys.

- Can I borrow your hat? This will be hilarious.

-  No. - Okay.

- Aloha, Uncle Phil!

- You guys excited about the trip?

- Oh, we're so excited. You know, this is my first time.

-  Really? Yeah, I know it's surprising.

- People always say I scream "Hawaii."

- Who says that?

-  People. - What people?

- You don't know them.

-  Hey, Lily! Hi. - Oh, no! Oh, n

- I forgot my wallet.

- Oh, that's all right. I have cash.

- No, no. I can't get on the plane without my I.D.

-  Thanks a lot, Cam. - How is this my fault?

- Because if you had done what I asked you to do this morning,

- then I wouldn't have been overwhelmed

- and I would have remembered my wallet.

- All right. We still need to pack Lily's toys,

- print the boarding passes.

- Oh, stop the newspaper.

- Wait. What are you doing? I just packed those.

- She just looks so cute in this outfit.

- I want her looking her best for Jasper.

- Nothing you just said made any sense to me.

- Jasper and his mother are coming over for a playdate.

- We scheduled it weeks ago.

-  We're about to leave for the airport. - Not for an hour.

- And this is the only time Jasper could do it.

- How full is Jasper's calendar?

- This is a coup. When you get in with Jasper,

- doors open.

- He's a legacy at Happy Time Preschool.

- We're kissing up to a 10-month-old?

- I just want him to like us.

- Okay, that's them.

- But just in and out.

- We still have a million things to do.

- Would you relax? You always worry. It always gets done.

- Oh, and we're Methodists, so

- Uh, who am I kidding? I'm not making this flight.

- Uh-uh. I can get you home

- and back before the plane takes off. Let's go.

- Daryl- See if you can stall the plane.

- That's- I will get to you later.

- I really- I really don't think there's enough time.

- Go. I'll meet you at the gate. Go.

-  But you won't get on the plane without me, right? - Oh. Well

- Seriously? You were gonna get on the plane? Cam!

- Just go!

- Nope. Gotta get that one.

- Okay. I can't

-  Oh! That's as fast as she goes. - Just drive.

-  Just drive. - I'll get the luggage!

- Hey, check out that cute guy.

- He's out of your league. He's reading a book.

- I know.

-  Here today, gone to Maui! - Hey. You seen Phil?

-  Oh, he drove Mitchell back to get his wallet. - What?

- Yeah. He said he's gonna make it back in time,

- but I think it's gonna be close.

- So he left me here.

- Haley is still asleep, and I have no idea where Luke is.

- And are you even ready?

- My bag's in the living room. Everything's gonna be okay.

- Okay. Fine. I'm sorry. I'm a little tense.

- Coffee'll help that.

- You're right.

- We've been over this. Air travel is incredibly safe.

- I know. I know. But at the end of the day,

- it is still a building on its side

- being thrown from one place to another.

-  With a movie. - Not helping.

- You wanna take something, maybe calm your nerves?

- No. No. I wanna be alert if the kids need me.

- What a mom. Sometimes I wish you were my mom.

- Oh, God, Phil. I'm already feeling a little queasy.

- I hate this feeling. I hate it.

- And it's just gonna get worse and worse until the flight.

- It's gonna be fine.

- Uncle Phil's here.

- Great job, buddy! First one ready.

- Haley and Alex, let's go!

- Bless you.

-  Coming. - All right. Come on, girls.

- Okay. This is why we practice.

-  Come on through. Come through. - Fifteen seconds.

-  Are we ready? - I think so.

- It's go time.

- Straight to the car. Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.

- Go, go, go, go, go. Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.

-  Very nice!  -Alright. Let's go. Let's go.

-  I think we got an extra couple of seconds. - No,

-  we don't. - Dad, come on!

- I will never get tired of this.

- Me neither.

- You know what would be cool, Mum?

- What's that?

- If the plane flew into a storm

- and crash-landed onto an island like in Lost.

- Something wrong there, Cam?

- Well, I'm just breaking in a new pair of hiking shoes.

- This always happens. All the men in my family have wide ankles.

- I have an uncle that can only wear bell bottoms. Hand to God.

- I wasn't doubtin' ya.

- Just why are you wearing the hiking shoes?

-  Surprise! - What, again?

- Every morning the whole family's gonna go hiking.

- Then at the end of the week,

- we all gonna make it to the top of the volcano.

- Every morning, huh?

- Yes. When Cam suggested it,

- I knew you were gonna love it.

-  Oh, so this was your idea? - Happy birthday, Jay.

- Ah, thanks, buddy. Ow.

- Hi, sweetheart!

-  I'm going hiking! - She's smiling!

- Thank you.

- Look, Mom, I'm pregnant.

- Yeah. You still gotta take your Dramamine.

- Oh, does somebody get a little motion sickness?

- Yeah, I throw up all the time.

- Oh, well, then Dramamine's the way to go.

- What the hell are you doing?

- Oh, I'm just trying to keep her awake

- so she'll sleep on the plane.

- Nobody likes a crying baby on a flight.

- It's-It's very stressful.

- Uh, last year I flew back from New York...

- next to a baby who was very upset the entire flight,

- and it was hell.

- I was on that flight with you, and I don't recall

- Oh, I get it. You're talking about me.

- That's very funny.

- Yeah, we couldn't get tickets to Billy Elliot.

- All he wanted to do was dance, and that's my story.

- Five hours of this.

-  I just want to dance at the ballet!

- Dramamine. Oh, I wish I had that the last time I flew.

- Tell you, the plane was rocking up and down, back and forth.

- I thought the wings were gonna snap off, honestly.

- you do it yourself. Use your teeth.

- I-Is this the best way to go? What about the freeway?

- Relax, punkin. I got this.

- It's all about knowing the route.

- You're talking to a guy who made his way

- through college by driving a pedicab.

-  You know what one of those is? - Yes. Yes.

- I just saw one pass us.

-  Quick- Who sang "Evil Woman"? - What?

- ELO!

- Phil, where the hell are you?

- Uh, let's see. Oh, shoot! I just missed my turn.

- You're supposed to be here with me.

- I told you, I get more and more freaked out

- as we get closer to the flight.

- Well, I know, but Mitch- Okay, you know what?

- I was counting on you to be here, so thanks a lot.

- She's pretty tightly wound.

- Some people are just built that way.

- Honestly, could you drive any slower?

- Guess where the world's largest wind generator is.

- Is it right behind me?

- Nope. It's on the island of Oahu.

- I'm thinking about using it in my song about Hawaii.

- What song?

-  Didn't Mom tell you? - Surprise!

- The whole family's putting on a show for you for your birthday.

- Everybody's performing. Even Phil brought his dummy.

- Isn't that great?

-  Jay? - Oh, I'm sorry.

- I was just thinking how tragic it would be

- if I fell into that volcano.

- Ay, papi, don't say that.

- Not yet, sweetie. Not yet.

- See? He's perfect.

- Look at him getting coffee and not putting chocolate in it.

- He's so mature.

- What about Dylan?

- Dylan's no that guy.

- Haley! Come on!

- We're leaving in two minutes! Get up!

-  Oh, my God! - Oh, no. Is it tomorrow?

- Dylan! What are you doing here?

- I was gonna go, but then you fell asleep,

- and since you're leaving for a week,

- I want to stare at you as long as I could.

- You have to go. My parents are gonna think we did it.

- As if.

- Get out of the house and make sure that nobody sees you.

- I'II miss you.

- When you're gone, it's like I'm

- this prisoner trapped in a cell of loneliness.

- That's beautiful, but you have to go.

- Okay.

- I hate this feeling. I hate it.

- And it's just gonna get worse and worse until the flight. - Hey!

- It's gonna be fine.

- Uncle Phil's here.

-  Great job, buddy! First one ready. - Thanks.

- Haley and Alex, let's go! Coming.

- Bless you.

-  Coming. - All right. Come on, girls.

- Okay.

-  This is why we practice. - Come on through. Come through.

-  Fifteen seconds. Are we ready? - Yes.

- It's go time.

- Straight to the car. Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.

- Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast. Straight through.

-  Very nice! - All right. Let's go. Let's go.

-  I think we got an extra couple of seconds. - No,

-  we don't. - Dad, come on!

-  Oh, no! - What?

- My keys!

- Stay awake, sweetie. Stay awake.

- Whee! Oh, no.

- This is where your Realtor training comes in handy.

- Looks like a standard Porter and Sons D-Model top lock.

- One quick swipe oughta pop it.

- All aboard.

-  Okay. - There we go.

- Nice and easy.

-  Yeah, you're pinching. You're pinching. - I'm sorry.

- If you show enough houses, you learn all the tricks.

- Every Realtor is just a ninja in a blazer.

- The average burglar breaks in

- and leaves clues everywhere,

- but not me.

- I'm completely clueless.

- You're sure I'm not too heavy?

- Please, you weigh less than my paintball gear.

-  Okay. Yup. - There we go. We are in.

- Off-load. On we go. Squeezing.

-  I'm going for a ride. - You all right?

- Yup. I'm good. I'm good.

- What are you doing?

- Just making it a little tougher on the next guy.

- You got to get up pretty early- Son of a

-  Are you all right? - Yes, I am.

- Just, uh, almost killed myself on your fire truck.

- That's not ours. That's Jasper's.

- You know Jasper?

- I sold a house to his parents.

- How did you ever get a playdate with him?

- Let's go! Please, can- yeah. Okay.

- Look at him. He's sketching.

- He's like Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic.

- I bet he goes to art school.

- Do you think he's sketching us?

- Yeah. "Us."

- Check-in for the 5:30 flight to Boston may board at this time.

- And contact.

- It's Dylan.

- "I'm trapped." Yeah, yeah, yeah. What a drama queen.

- We will go whale washing,

- explore the tropical forest,

- get back into the nature.

- That sounds fun. Mm-hmm.

-  Thanks. - Thank you.

- Your attention, please.

- Will Manny Delgado please report to Gate 22-A?

- Manny Delgado to Gate 22-A.

- Check it out, Grandpa. The Dramamine's working.

- I'm not dizzy.

- Yeah. Oh, watch the drink, kid.

- Ooh! Ooh, my Ludlums!

-  I'm sorry, Grandpa. - All right. Relax, relax.

- We might be okay here.

- It's not fair. It's not fair.

- Excuse me, ma'am. Is this Manny Delgado?

-  Yes. - Your son's name is on a no-fly list.

- Ay, please, we've been through this at the check-in.

- He's not the same Manny Delgado.

- I'm just a boy trying to bring style back to travel.

-  We just have a few questions to ask. - No, this is a mistake.

-  Where is my husband? Wait. Jay! - Step this way, ma'am.

- Ma'am, step this way, please.

-  Son, step this way. - Jay! No pushing. Jay!

- You make it a double? I'm traveling with my family.

- No problem.

- Must be a lot easier just living with a guy.

- Yeah, life would be simpler if I was gay.

- Do you think you could get in the fast lane?

-  Oh, I could totally get in the fast lane. - I mean the road.

- Oh, I'm getting a text. What does it say?

- Um- Oh, G- Well, it's nothing. It's the alarm company.

-  It says your house was broken into. - What?

- It's nothing. They'll take care of it. Just drive!

- What happened?

- Okay, fun airport game.

- You pick out a traveler, you come up with their entire story.

- Okay. This guy, his name's Henry.

- He's on his way to Phoenix to visit his grandmother,

- whose name is, uh

- Oh! Pass.

-  Too hard. Your turn. - Okay. Fine.

- I see a woman, uh, wracked with fear,

- whose husband has abandoned her.

-  Where? Where? Who is she? - Me.

- I made it perfectly clear to Phil that I needed him here.

- Oh. It's going around. Mitchell's mad at me too.

- He thinks because I didn't help him pack this morning,

- he forgot his wallet.

- I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry to be snippy.

- It's just... I'm a little upset with Cam.

- I needed his help this morning, and he let me down.

- That doesn't sound like him.

- You asked him to do something and he didn't do it?

- But he never asked! I mean, all he said was,

- "Lily's bag needs to be packed

- and the newspaper needs to be canceled."

- That sounds to me like he was asking for help.

- Sounds to me like you expected him to read your mind.

-  What am I, a psychic? - No! It's not about reading minds.

- It's about knowing what your partner needs.

- Here's an idea: Just say "Help me."

- You don't even have to say "Me," Just "Help."

- Then he'll know exactly what you want.

- You won't have to get all mad.

- I'm not mad. It's just

- You wanna believe you're on the same wavelength as someone,

- and then it's just

- it's a little disheartening when you find out you're not.

- That's all.

- What's frustrating is I would do anything for Mitchell,

- and-and frankly, it's a little hurtful that he doesn't know that.

- So, airports, huh?

- Yeah.

- Are you drawing something there?

- Yeah. It's no good.

- Tortured artist. Classic.

- Oh, yeah.

-  It's a robot. - Oh, yeah. Sure is.

-  What's behind him? - A dinosaur.

- It's for school. We're supposed to make a comic strip.

- We had to do that too, back in the eighth

- He was 14 years old.

- Shut up.

- "He's my soul mate."

- I d

- This is the final boarding announcement for

- What you drinking?

- Dad. Hey.

- Mostly tonic actually, thanks to my new sponsor here.

- I'm a little jittery about flying.

- What are you talking about? You fly all the time.

- Yeah, I know. This started just in the last couple years.

- I think I'm just- I'm nervous

- 'cause I've got so much to lose now, you know?

- What about you?

- I'm taking a break from my vacation.

- We haven't even started yet.

- Well, I gotta figure, I might not have a lot of time for myself,

- you know, what with the luaus, the hiking, the talent shows.

- Are you not happy that we're coming with you?

- It's just not what I expected.

- But, Dad, doesn't it feel good to know...

- that your whole family is willing to drop everything to be with you,

- to fly across the ocean in a steel coffin?

- I'm gonna finish that.

- It's not you guys. I love the family.

- It just kinda feels like Gloria's going out of her way...

- not to spend time with me.

- You don't believe that, do you?

- Oh, come on, Dad!

- That is so crazy and so adorable.

- That woman loves you.

- Well, I didn't say I wasn't lovable.

- It's not every wife that would spend the money

- to fly a family to Hawaii.

- Okay. Where does everybody think Gloria's money comes from?

- So, what kind of business did you have in Japan?

- I've never been to Japan.

- You didn't go to Osaka

- November 2003 to attend an electronics trade show?

- I was four.

- Enough. Why don't you question the other people on the gate, huh?

- Did you see the old lady with the cane?

- What if she has a ceramic knife

- in there that can go through the metal detector?

- And yet you waste your time harassing a little kid.

- Ma'am, you seem to know an awful lot about

- sneaking contraband on to a plane.

- Yeah, I'm Colombian.

- Have you ever been to Japan?

- I would like to make a phone call.

- Ladies and gentlemen, preboarding for our flight to Maui...

- will begin in the next few minutes.

-  Luke, please stop spinning. - Sorry.

- Now make the airport stop spinning.

- We made it! Claire!

- Oh, my God. Thank God you're here.

- Oh, honey!

-  I am so sorry. - It was my fault.

-  It wasn't your fault. - I should have known what you wanted.

-  Are you drunk? - Kinda.

- And once I spent a week in Cancún,

- which, by the way, did not live up to the hype.

- Can somebody tell me what the hell is going on?

- We're almost done here, sir.

-  So you and your son are traveling together? - Yes.

- Then why are you departing Maui on different dates?

- Well, because he's traveling back home with his family.

-  What? - Surprise!

- They're only staying for six days.

-  The rest of the time it's only you and me. - Really?

- Mm-hmm. I wanted to spend some time alone with my husband

- drink cocktails by the pool, sleep in.

- I could not love you any more than I do right now.

- I also found a topless beach.

- I was wrong.

- Mr. Jackson, have a great flight.

- It's to the left. Oh, gorgeous!

-  Oh, thank you. It's vintage. - Think he meant Lily.

- You don't know that.

- Hey, there's another hottie for you at 5:00.

- I think he's an artist.

- It's whale "Watching."

-  Whale washing. - Watching.

-  Washing. - That's close enough.

- Have a good flight, sir.

- Quick, do your zombie impression.

-  She hasn't been drinking, has she? - Oh, no, no, no.

- She's- She's hilarious. Okay, let's do bride of Frankenstein.

- It's so, so good.

S01E23 
----------------------
-  Aloha, Lily. - Aloha. 

- Oh, wait. Let's do it one more time.

-  The doggy was blocking her face. - Yeah, 

-  Go back. - No. No! No.

- We're not doing it a third time.

- There she is- the prettiest white woman on Maui. Milady.

- Actually, Claire and I were supposed to

-  go to Hawaii for our honeymoon. - Mm-hmm.

- But something else came up.

-  I got pregnant with Haley. - My bad!

- We didn't even have a proper wedding.

- We just went down to the courthouse on a Tuesday.

- The judge sentenced me to life with no chance of parole.

- You begged me to marry you.

- It's true. I did.

- Oh! Hold on, my bride. Allow me!

- What are you doing?

- Being romantic. God, you're solid.

- Sweetie, put me down. Go on. Okay.

- Honey, come on. 

- Let's turn this vacation into a honeymoon.

- Sweet pea, I'm a mom traveling with my kids.

- For me, this is not a vacation.

- It's a business trip. Let's go.

- This'll do.

-  It's beautiful. - Aloha!

- Hi! Welcome to the Four Seasons Maui.

- What do you think, Manny?

- I'm home.

- I can't believe we have our own hotel room.

- Score! There's an iron in here!

- Don't you want to keep our room neat?

- You know, in case we entertain.

- Who would we entertain?

- I noticed some lovely tweens down by the kids' club.

- Maybe we can find a nice spot near them by the pool...

- and send over a couple of virgin mai tais.

- They may be interested in two sophisticated men like us.

- I am a bathroom martian!

- I am from the nebula of the Great Toilet.

- I want the biggest cheeseburger you got.

- Instead of salad, I want fries.

- Instead of fruit, I want chili fries.

- Haley, sweetie, put the phone down

- and put on some sunscreen. Please?

- We have got to stay on these kids all day,

-  or else they're gonna burn. - Totally.

- They put on the littlest bit of sunscreen in the morning,

- they think it's got them covered for the

- Are you watching Gloria in my sunglasses?

- Is she moving in slow motion, or is my brain doing that?

-  Phil, this is important. - Go ahead. I'm glistening.

- Hey, everybody.

- We're on our way to see the world's largest banyan tree.

- Does anybody want to come?

- Now, why in the hell would anyone want to leave paradise,

- take a hot bus ride to see a tree?

- The great thing about Cameron is that,

- uh, he's adventurous, like I am.

- We-We both like to immerse ourselves in the culture

- and really get to know the locals.

- We've made friends all over the world.

- We're still in touch with Elunga,

- a man we met on safari in Tanzania.

- We actually send him... all of our old clothes.

- He was a very nice man when we met him,

- but based on his recent letters,

- I have a small fear he's become a warlord.

- Hey. I'm gonna go to the gym to work out a little bit.

- You want to come with me?

- I just ordered an extra-long straw

- to avoid accidentally doing a sit-up.

- Ah, look at this.

- My brother.

- What's up, jackass? 

- Happy birthday, you dumb son of a bitch.

- Birthday's tomorrow, moron!

- I never understood this relationship.

-  So, 63, right? - Hey, you can count!

- You know Dad was 63 when he died. Huh?

-  Hello? - Thanks for reminding me.

- Ah, don't worry. He never took care of himself.

- Ate like crap and drank too much. 

- Anyway, Irene's begging me for

- Hey, Gloria, wait up. I'm coming.

- So, I was thinking we book a couples' massage.

- I accidentally looked in on one.

- They seemed really relaxed until they noticed me.

- Haley, that's enough. Get off the phone.

- Luke, pull up your trunks!

- This bathing suit looks great on you.

- Thanks, sweetie. Haley, come on. Off the phone.

- No way. Keira got her hair straightened?

- Claire, consider this a grand gesture of my love.

- What are you

- Oh, my God!

-  What did you do? - Phil, what are you thinking?

- That is an expensive cell phone.

- It's just the beginning.

- Buckle your seat belt, lady. You're being wooed.

- In nature, fathers are known to eat their young.

- Is it because they're delicious? No.

- It's because they want to give their female

- bear, giraffe, what have you- 

- the honeymoon they never had.

- Just to be clear, I'm not condoning eating your kids,

- but I sure as heck know why giraffes do it.

- What?

-  Come on, sleepy! - Ay, Jay!

- Come on, honey! Get out of bed! 

- I just booked us on an outrigger.

- But it is your birthday. 

- You don't want to sleep in?

-  Come here. - No, no, 

- I just came from the gym. Guess how much I benched.

-  I don't know. 500 pounds? - 500 pounds?

- What am I, a forklift?

- To tell you the truth,

- that call from my brother scared the hell out of me.

- I decided to get in better shape quick.

- Didn't want to end up like my old man.

- Although he did die doing what he loved

- refusing service to hippies who came into his store.

- Manny is the worst roommate ever.

- Everything he finds, he folds.

- Sweetie, it's only for a few more days.

- Last night we had a fire drill.

- Not the hotel. Just us.

-  Hi, guys. - Hey.

- So, what's today's big adventure?

- I'll bet the kids want to go with you.

- Well, it is a big one- the lavender ranch,

-  where they grow 45 different varieties of lavender. - Forty-five.

- Hear that, kids? Forty-five different varieties.

- Yeah, I can't sell that. Go with God.

- Oh. Well, more lavender for us.

- When Mitchell and I first met,

- I may have exaggerated my interest in adventurous travel...

- by implying that I had any.

- But it's one of the things he loves most about me,

- and I can't tell him the truth now.

- It would be like Lewis telling Clark 

- that he didn't like to walk.

- Side note.

- We're very good friends with a couple named Lewis and Clark.

- Clark bought a big, sparkly belt in New Orleans

- that he calls his Louisiana Purchase.

- Mom, Haley keeps stealing my iPod.

- All my music is on my phone. What else am I supposed to do?

- Manny watches the news. 

- You guys don't even watch the news.

- Aloha. Hi. Sorry, folks. 

- This pool is for adults only.

-  Don't turn around. - What?

- Trust me. Just keep walking.

- Wait! Where are you guys going?

- Guys?

- What just happened?

- Ooh, so we can drink lavender tea 

- while eating lavender scones.

- Oh, neat! So, is this an all-day thing or

- Oh, no. I know what you're thinking, Cam.

- Don't worry. We'll still have time for the whaling village.

- Oh. Good. So

- Okay.

-  I can't. - What?

- I don't want to go.

- I know I said 

- I'm not a stay-by-the-pool type of guy,

- but I really am, Mitchell.

- What are you saying?

- I'm saying that I like adventure,

- but not every minute of every day.

- Can you just go by yourself?

- But... the lavender ranch

- It's- It's something two men are meant to do together.

-  On or off, folks? - Well, I'm on.

- I'm off.

- Think about what you're missing, Cam.

- It's an entire ranch full of lavender.

- You're not making the compelling case you think you are!

- Hey, you little monkey!

- No standing around! There you go!

- Here goes another one! There you go!

- Here comes another one! There you go!

- I thought you were one of ours!

- Hey, Jay! Be careful!

- You're gonna hurt somebody- like you!

- Don't get too comfortable. 

-  I reserved us a tennis court. - Yay.

- I thought that one of the advantages of marrying an older guy...

- was that I was going to be able to relax.

- But all this swimming and running and rowing

- It's just like how some of my relatives got into this country.

- You know- Mmm.

- You look prettier now than the day we got married.

- Oh, honey. And you are even more handsome.

- I did push-ups in the bathroom.

- You're funny.

-  You're nice. -I have always been nice.

- I've always been funny.

- Well

- Mom! Dad!

- Ignore her. That could be anyone.

- Phil and Claire Dunphy?

- Yes, Haley, honey? What is it?

- I'm gonna go get some shaved ice at the hotel

- next door with some kids.

-  What kids? - Just some kids I met at the pool.

-  Okay. Um- I should go with her and - Claire, no.

- You have to learn to let go.

- Turning a family vacation into a honeymoon takes commitment.

- You can do it. Eye of the tiger.

- Hello!

-  I should at least meet them. I - No.

- That is not eye of the tiger.

- All right, Haley, honey, go and have fun,

- but don't get in anybody's car...

- and be back in time for your grandfather's birthday dinner, okay?

- Thank you!

-  Okay! All right! - Bye, honey!

- Oh, God.

- That feels weird and good all at once.

- I know. I was leaning up against that nozzle a minute ago.

-  Hey. - Hey, you're back. How was it?

- Ah! Cameron, it was the most incredible thing 

- I've ever seen in my entire life.

-  Really? - You know who else was there?

-  Who - Elton John.

-  No- -Yes, and he was so blown away by the beauty of it,

- he sat down... at their lavender piano

- and played "Tiny Dancer."

- And we bonded, because he too likes adventure.

-  Did that really happen? - No, that didn't really happen. 

- I'm just...

- trying to get back at you for bailing on me.

- I'm sorry. If it means anything,

- we've been relaxing here doing nothing.

-  Maybe you can join us tomorrow. - No, I can't- I just don't

-  I don't find relaxing that relaxing. - I understand.

- You are who you are.

-  Leilani. - Yes.

- You know what? I think it's because of my parents.

- It always is. Kipu!

- I mean, vacation with my mom and dad

- was them sitting around like statues...

- when, the only thing that me and Claire could do for excitement was

- Was sit around and listen to my skin sizzle.

-  You poor thing. Sue? - Yes.

- So, that's, like- That's why, when I'm on vacation,

- I want to go out and meet the locals.

- I want to immerse myself in the culture, you know?

- I don't want to sloth around- Ah!

- Sweet Lady Gaga, that is good.

- Thank you.

- What's this called?

- Happiness.

- I'm curious. Is there any sand left on the beach,

- or did you bring it all up to our bathroom?

- Sorry, Mom.

- And now you're sitting on my linen jacket.

- I guess I can't have nice things.

-  Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't know it was there. - It's okay.

- No! Stop!

- I'm wearing that tonight!

- I'm wrinkling your linen! I'm wrinkling your linen!

- Ooh! You know what? Out!

- I want you out! This isn't working!

- I don't care where you go, as long as you don't stay here!

- What are you saying?

- What don't you understand about "Out"?

- Fine. I'll just move in with my sisters.

- Oh, no! Who will pee all over the bathroom floor?

- I was brushing my teeth at the same time.

- You try to do that.

- What'd you do today?

-  I napped. - You did?

-  I haven't napped in years. - Yeah. It feels good, doesn't it?

- Mm-hmm. Good and weird.

- Kinda like that one nozzle in the infinity pool.

- I wouldn't know. Phil was hogging it.

- Is it me, or is Lily more relaxed here?

- Oh, yes. She is.

- I think it's because she's really picking up on our energy, you know?

- It's like, if we're tense, she's gonna be tense.

- And I think we need to bring this new energy home.

- It's gonna make us better parents

-  You blocked the - What? What happened?

-  You didn't bring her out! - I thought you had her!

- Come on. Let me paint you.

- Oh, sweetie. That is so creepy.

- Where is everyone?

- Okay. Let me just say what everyone's thinking.

- My jacket's a mess.

- It wouldn't be,

- but someone used the iron to make grilled cheese.

- I had bread, I had cheese and I had an iron.

- What was I supposed to do?

- Kids, kids. We don't care.

- Hola, hola!

- Hey. So sorry I'm late. Where is Jay?

- He's not with you? 

- No, he came down long time ago.

- Oh, don't worry. I'll go have a look around.

- Yeah, he's probably in the ocean trying to

- pull a tugboat with his teeth.

- Well, look who decided to join us.

-  And where is your sister? - She is in our bathroom throwing up.

- Well, what happened? 

- You're not going to like this as much as I do,

- but she's drunk.

- I-I knew I never should have let her

- That's awesome.

- Guarantee our bathroom is still messier.

- Oh, my God! Lily! Where is the elevator?

- Where- I don't know! I'm taking the stairs!

- Lily, we're coming for you!

- Hey, you. Where you headed?

- Well, remember earlier in the pool when you convinced me...

- to let Haley go next door with complete strangers?

-  And you were totally on board. - Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, well,

- she got drunk, and now she's upstairs throwing up.

- But she's just a kid. Who would serve her?

- We did, honey. On a silver platter.

- You convinced me to relax and let go, 

- and now this happens.

- I'm sorry, but we shouldn't feel bad...

- About wanting a little time for ourselves.

- Sweetie, this isn't a honeymoon.

- We have kids. You have got to let this go.

- From now on, I am not losing sight of them for two seconds.

- Nothing gets past me.

- Did you find Jay? 

- I'm getting worried.

- I'm sorry. I have to deal with Haley.

- No. You know what, sweetie? I will deal with Haley.

- You go see if you can find Dad. 

- I'll look for him out there.

- Lily, where are you going, huh?

- Oh, my God.

-  I'm so sorry. - Oh, my God. 

- Wow. What were you thinking?

- One of the kids had an I.D., and she bought some drinks.

- I tried one, and then another one. 

- It was stupid.

- Yes. Yes, it was stupid,

- but you are really lucky

- that this did not end as badly as it could have.

- This is why we always say to you...

- when you drink, you make bad decisions.

- I know, I know. I just

- One minute you're having wine coolers at homecoming,

- and the next...

- the game of Truth or Claire sweeps your high school.

- Thanks for not yelling at me.

- Oh, honey. That would just be cruel.

- I'II wait till you feel better to yell.

- I don't think I'll ever feel better.

- Does this happen every time you drink?

- Yes.

- Yes, it does.

- Jay?

- Over here.

- What are you doing?

- I'm stuck. I laid down, my back went out.

- Oh. Well, don't you worry. We're gonna get you out of here.

-  Grab on. - Yeah, you know, Phil, this might not be the best

- No, no, no, no, no. 

- I'm just gonna rock you- like a hurricane.

- I'm kidding. You're too old to get that. Here we go.

- Wait. Why don't you just get someone who works here?

- No, this is gonna work.

- And now- Oh, wow!

- There's spasming.

-  Don't move. - No. I don't wanna get

- By the way, I just want to thank you for this trip.

- It's really been a vacation of a lifetime.

- Nothing weird!

- Aloha.

- I keep my wallet in my front pocket, so that's

- that's what that is.

- Neck... going.

- I'm sorry.

-  Anyone! Anyone, help! - Alert security!

- Seal off the island!

- This- This way! This way!

- Lily!

- Aha. You looking for someone?

- Lily. We were so worried. We just got distracted.

-  Oh, we're idiots.  - Ay! Don't beat yourself up.

- I used to lose Manny all the time.

- Now I lost your father. These things happen.

- She's right, you know.

- Did she say my father's missing?

- We say we'll make time, but life gets in the way.

- I mean, I know we're parents,

- but can't we be lovers too?

- This may be my worst birthday ever.

- There you are!

- Oh, hi, honey.

- He was stuck in a hammock. It was actually really funny.

-  I was on top of him for, like, 20 minutes. - You need to go now.

- Good night. Honey.

- My back seized up.

- Yeah, because you overdid it

- after that phone call about your father.

- I can't believe I'm as old as he was.

- Wait. Sit down here.

-  You'd have liked him- my old man. - I'm sure.

- And he'd have loved you.

- My God, that guy- He was a charmer.

- Mmm, I know the type.

- And we had a lot of fun.

- But I'll tell you something.

- Our family vacations were nothing like this here.

- One week a year in a rented cottage on Lake Erie,

- spiders this big.

- I just wish he could have seen how things turned out.

- Well, if you keep going like this,

- maybe you can tell him yourself.

- Or I can tell him, because you're about to kill me, Jay.

- My legs, my arms, my back- everything is sore.

- So I wore you out, huh? 

- Oh, no, no, no. Don't get cocky, old man.

- When I sit down, I can still get up. Eh.

- Hey, uh- Okay, come on.

- Come here. Come here.

- The rest of the trip went better. 

- Haley's room stopped spinning.

-  Yes, it is. - And a monkey

- There she is!

- Oh, honey! Hey!

-  Do you want some eggs Benedict? So creamy! - No.

- No?

- Jay got back to the vacation he always wanted.

- And Mitch and Cam managed to do some sightseeing...

- at a working banana plantation

-  Lily! - Where they promptly lost Lily again.

- Why did you dress her in jungle prints?

- Because I thought it would be cute!

- She's gonna think she's back in Vietnam! 

- Lily! Lily, honey!

- Me and Claire, we

- we had a great time.

- But we never did get that honeymoon.

- I think I just expected a little too much from this vacation.

- You were so sweet to try.

- It was dumb.

- Like you said, the thrill is gone.

-  I never said that. - No, it's over.

- But wait. Put a few seconds back on the clock.

- The kid still has a few moves.

- Oh, my God.

- I figured out why we couldn't have a honeymoon.

- Because we never had a wedding.

- Oh, my God.

- I still can't tell if you think this is lame or cool.

- Honey, it's incredibly cool.

-  Looks like I finally get to walk you down the aisle. - Daddy!

- Ow! You better walk me.

- Okay. I'll do that.

- We're here today to celebrate the renewing of the marriage vows...

- of Phil and Claire.

- On this day they've chosen to reaffirm their love for each other.

- You may kiss your bride. Oh!

- I present to you, still as husband and wife,

- Mr. And Mrs. Dunphy.

- Welcome to the nonstop flight from Maui to Los Angeles.

- Thank for you choosing Continental Airlines.

- Thank you.

- You know, honey,

- if anything were ever to happen to me,

- I would want you to get remarried.

- Okay.

- That was a little fast. 

- Oh, no. I just want to make you happy.

- Okay.

-  Any idea of who you would remarry? - Vicky Conroy probably.

- She works in my office.

- She's very organized. The kids love her.

-  Are you guys talking about Vicky? - Yeah.

- Mom, she's awesome.

- Just so you know, if something were to happen to me, I

- Something's gonna happen to you, all right.

S01E24 
----------------------
-  Oh, hey, honey. Have a great time at the game. - Thanks.

- Oh. Why are you crunching?

- Ordinarily, I'm a rule follower,

- but when someone tells me I can't bring

- my own snacks into their stadium,

- that's when I get a little nuts.

- It's a free country, right?

- Let's just say it ruffles me...

- when some goobers tell me...

- I have to spend half my payday...

- on their hot dogs.

- Please, just remember the family portrait.

-  We only have the photographer for an hour. Okay? - Okay.

- And, sweetie, did you have a chance to

- try on the white pants I put in your closet?

- Oh, what do they look like?

- Is there really a more clear way to describe white pants?

- Sweetie, if they don't fit you,

- you're going to be the only one not wearing white,

- and then you're gonna stand out like "Where's Waldo?"

- Actually, "Where's Waldo?" doesn't stand out.

- He's super hard to find. That's the challenge.

- This portrait is incredibly important to me.

- Also, his name is just "Waldo."

- I spent weeks trying to find

- a time that works for everybody...

- and finding the right photographer.

- So if you could just promise me that you'll cooperate, okay?

-  I promise. -Okay.

-  This is amazing that you're doing this. - Mmm, thank you.

-  You're wonderful. - Thank you.

- Get in here

-  Oh, no can do. - Oh.

-  I love you. - Bye.

- Where's my good underwear?

- The question is,

- why isn't all your underwear good, Jay?

- You make a nice living.

- The new maid keeps mixing up my underwear with Manny's.

- Put on the first thing I grabbed.

- It was like a crotch tourniquet.

-  You gotta talk to her. - Why me?

- Hola. You both speak the same language.

- She's Portuguese. Do you know how offensive it is...

- that you put all of us in the same mixing pot?

- Sorry. Please apologize to her when you tell her not to

-  put my underwear- - I can't talk to her!

-  Where's Luke? - I'm going instead.

- Luke suddenly remembered a school project due tomorrow.

- Oh, that's tough.

- But it's a good lesson for the kid.

- You know, you make a commitment,

-  you gotta follow through. - Yeah.

- What is the project?

- He has to interview somebody who lived through the 1960s.

- Oh, no.

- Hello.

- Yeah, Luke.

- Oh, sure. I remember what I said.

- Yeah, come on over. All right.

- Gloria, you're gonna have to take Manny to the game.

- Yay. Manny, vamos!

- I'm still getting dressed.

- Hey, Mom, I think my diet's working.

- My underwear won't stay up.

- Oh, so delicious. Yes.

- Hey, you're okay with me not going with you today, right?

- I have been hired to sing at a wedding this weekend.

- I was plucked from obscurity

- after a particularly stirring karaoke performance.

- So I guess you could say I'm a professional singer now.

- Well, they're paying you in flowers, so

- Well, I would've blown the money on flowers anyway.

- They're saving me a step.

- Plus all the great divas are rewarded in flowers.

- They're also given paychecks.

- And I'm really bad at small talk, so

- I get it. It's not a problem.

- Are you sure? 'Cause you've been quiet all morning.

- It's because I'm resting my instrument.

- Okay.

- I feel tension.

- Kobe! Kobe, over here!

- Kobe! Kobe! Over here!

- What can I do for you?

- Do you like being a basketball player?

- Serious?

- I choked. I didn't think you'd look up here at me.

- Little preparation next time.

- It's a mental game.

- Duly noted.

-  All right. - Your Los Angeles Lakers!

-  What's wrong? - That broken step.

- It's gonna ruin our whole family portrait.

- Okay, here's my idea. I'm really excited about it.

- The whole extended family, all dressed in white,

- in a single-file line down the staircase.

- Oh, like a line on the highway.

- No.

- Or, uh, a ski jump.

- No.

- Why- Why would I want a ski jump?

- I don't know.

- My idea was to have the whole family in a giant bed,

- like in Willy Wonka.

- Yeah, but that's ridiculous.

- "Ridiculicious."

- I don't see anything.

- So I'm crazy?

- No. You're... not.

- Your father was supposed to fix that step.

- Mom, you're obsessing over the tiniest little thing

- So you do see it, yeah.

- What is the big deal about this one picture?

- Honey, you know what,

- I don't expect you to understand, but

- All right, when you're a mom,

- everything goes by so quickly.

- In a minute, Luke's gonna be shaving,

- and Alex is gonna be off at college, and you're gonna be

- you'll be doing something great.

- I just wanna freeze this moment as it is right now.

-  You know? - I do.

- I know I don't show it,

- but this family's still the most important thing

- Screw it.

- I'm gonna fix the bastard.

- I mean, seriously, how hard can it be?

- If your father can do it, I can do it. Right?

- All right.

- I just need to...

- lift

- Oh, now I see it.

- These seats are amazing.

- Why you have candy coming out of your pocket?

- No, no, no, no, no.

-  Huh? - I brought my own snacks.

- Not because I'm cheap. It's a matter of principle.

- Plus I get a little rush from the danger.

- Be cool. Be cool.

-  What? - Be cool. Just look straight ahead.

- I never felt more alive. Whoo!

- Okay, I just made it worse. I'm not freaking out though.

- I'm gonna call your dad, and he's gonna tell me how to fix this.

-  Oh, my God! It's Dad. - Where?

- Right there, behind Kobe.

-  Oh, my god! - How weird is this!

- Quick. Quick, tell me something to say that will freak him out.

-  Tell him I'm pregnant. - No, not gonna say that.

- Okay, here we go. How funny is this!

- Hey, it's Phil. You know what to do.

- Well, that was pretty funny.

- Oh, my God!

- Oh, my God.

- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

- Oh, my God. Oh.

- It's much better. Excuse me. Sorry.

- Hello?

- There is a pigeon in our house.

- What do I do? What do I do?

- Who is this?

-  Never funny. Not funny now. - Calm down.

- You know I grew up around many animals.

- One time, a rooster attacked me,

- and my mom wrung its neck, and we had it for dinner.

- Great time for an anecdote. Help me.

- It's more afraid of you than you are of it.

- Pigeons aren't scared of anything.

- They stand on electrical wires.

- You're gonna be fine, Mitchell. Just as long as you don't

- You know what, they're starting.

- I gotta go. Okay, bye.

- As long as I don't what? Cam?

- As long as I don't- Oh, God!

- Cool. The kiss cam.

- Wouldn't it be embarrassing if the camera

-  was on us and then the crowd started- - We're related.

- Not by blood.

- Touch me and there will be blood.

-  Not us. - What's wrong with you?

- It's the kiss cam.

- When it lands on you, you're supposed to kiss.

- This is my wife's dad's second wife.

- So legally okay, but still weird.

- That was awkward.

- And we're back.

- Oh. Ay! Come on. It's not a big deal.

- Thank God for caller I.D.

- So you don't have to talk to your wife.

- Oh, we're gonna talk, mister.

- We're gonna talk and talk.

- Dad, Mom saw you on TV. You're dead.

- Here's the thing. The kiss cam is only supposed to be...

- for the enjoyment of the people at the game.

- They never show that on TV.

- What people do in the privacy of their own sports arena...

- should be their own business.

- So in '66, I worked in my grandfather's office supply business

- you know, your ink, your staples, your legal pads.

- Am I going too fast for you?

- I fell asleep for a second.

- Did you do anything interesting in the '60s?

- Well, one summer,

- I swept up hair at my other grandfather's barbershop.

-  You're killing me. - What do you want?

- I don't know.

- Brian Beckwith's grandfather marched on Washington.

- Artie Beckwith?

- He couldn't walk two feet without complaining.

- He marched on Washington?

- He told Brian he did.

- With Martin Luther King Jr.

- Martin Luther King?

-  Guess who cut his hair. - What?

- Do you know who cut Martin Luther King Jr.'s hair?

- Neither does Luke's teacher.

-  So the barbershop was in Washington? - Okay.

-  Did you cut any other famous hair? - Oh, yeah.

- The Kennedys, Richard Nixon, all the astronauts.

- How do you think Buzz Aldrin got his nickname?

- Awesome.

- *We love to play in Lily's room*

- *We don't need any milk*

- Okay, you know what, Lily? I am a man.

- I am going into the kitchen to get your milk.

- *Ave Maria*

- *Gratia plena*

- *Maria, gratia plena*

- *Maria, gratia plena*

- *Ave, ave dominus*

- *Dominus tecum*

- *Benedicta tu in mulieribus*

- *Et benedictus fructus ventris*

- *Ventris tui, Jesus*

- *Ave Maria*

- Then one day, Wilt Chamberlain shows up.

- He says, "Can you take a little off the top for my friend here?"

-  And it's Elvis. - No way.

- Greatest singer that ever lived, after Sinatra.

- I'll fight any man who says different.

- My dad says the greatest singer who ever lived is Peabo Bryson.

- Then I guess I gotta fight your dad.

- Yeah, I guess.

- Luke says Grandpa wants to fight you.

- Why does everything have to suck?

- Let's just do the picture another day.

- I think I'm getting a pimple.

- No.

- Do you know how long it took me to book this photographer?

- Maybe by the fireplace.

- Yeah. That's a classic old-person spot for a portrait.

- Yeah, if I'd ever bothered to paint that hideous wall.

- Claire is a perfectionist, which sometimes is a good thing,

- like when it comes to picking a husband.

- Sometimes it's a bad thing,

- like when everyone else sees something beautiful...

- and all she sees is the teeny-tiny flaw.

- No. No.

- No.

- Hi. My house is a disaster.

- Can we do this picture at your place?

- Yeah, that's- that's not gonna work.

- So

- Maybe one more layer. And tight, really tight.

-  Dad, can you call them again? - I just did.

- They're on their way. Game went into overtime.

- I know, but we're losing the light,

- and the photographer's

- gotta get to a bar mitzvah in 10 minutes.

- Oh, red wine. Really? Now?

- You know, honey,

- I think you're getting a little too uptight about this.

-  It's hard to breathe. - Oh, you're fine.

- What'd you do to him? He's turning blue.

- But his clothes will stay white.

-  We're home! - Oh, thank God.

- Manny, let's go change.

- Hey, there's my beautiful wife.

- I know you're mad at me,

- and I know this foam finger can't make up for everything.

- Honey, you just go change,

- and we'll talk about what you did later.

- Hey, thank you so much for those tickets.

- Gloria tells me you had a real good time.

- Not really. No, I didn't.

- God, I love your daughter.

- I should- I should come by

- and kiss that step- fix that step.

- Oh, you're acting like I wanted to destroy the house.

- No. I just think it's odd

- that the majority of things you destroyed...

- were sent to us by my mom.

- Okay, okay, okay.

- So while I'm fighting off that filthy creature,

- I actually stop and say, "Oh, you know what,

- here's the opportunity I've always been looking for

- to destroy our kitschiest objects."

- Kitschiest? Oh, she's gonna love that.

- If you would've come with me to the wedding,

- none of this would have happened.

- Okay. So you are angry.

- Mitchell, I get it.

- You're terrified of small talk and birds.

- You're just lucky that pigeon

- didn't want to chat you up about the weather.

-  Hello, Jay. - Hello, guys.

- Oh, God. Oh, you look like the guy from Dance Fever.

- Thank you.

- Deney Terrio. Cleveland, Ohio.

- Dad, really? That is not a compliment.

- That's why I wanted you to try those on earlier. Turn around.

- The picture can't happen today. My pimple's getting worse.

- Oh, honey, I am so sorry. Can you stand?

-  Yeah. - Well, then the picture's happening.

- It's all anybody's gonna see.

- I wouldn't be so sure about that.

- Did you get a look at her dress?

- What? Why would I look at her dress? I love you.

- Uh, Mrs. Dunphy, the sun is setting.

- Okay. Yeah, this is happening.

- Everybody, come on. Let's go.

- Be careful. I stained some furniture out there this afternoon.

- Of course you did, Dad.

- Anything else I need to know about?

- Maybe the neighbors on either side are having a paintball fight.

- Now watch this. Dad, in his infinite wisdom,

- stained furniture today.

- Don't touch it. It's wet.

-  Hurry, hurry. - Put that down, sweetheart.

- Okay. Okay, we got it. Now we're gonna go out here.

- Oh, my God! Are you kidding me?

- How do- How do you turn the sprinklers off?

- Ay! Of course! Because I'm Latina,

- I'm supposed to know everything about gardening and sprinklers!

- You were here when they installed it.

- Ay, yeah. The box is across the yard.

- You mean your now-soaking-wet yard?

- That's great. We are screwed.

- No, we're not.

- We haven't unwrapped our secret weapon yet.

- Luke walks over there, Hurt Locker style...

- flips the switch,

- and boom- or not boom- water off.

- Put the "he" in "hero," son.

- Hurt Locker? It's more like Squirt Locker.

- Really? That wasn't funny?

- I actually pity you guys.

- No time to celebrate! Stop it!

-  We don't have a lot of time. - All right, everybody.

-  If I can have the little ones down front- - You know what, sir?

- If you don't mind, I've got this.

- Come on, people, let's get out here.

- Haley, Alex, I need you to unwrap your brother.

- All right, I need the Dunphys over on this side.

- Dad, you're in the middle.

- Mitchell, Cam, Lily on this end. Okay.

-  Listen. - Uh-huh?

- Honey, I screwed up, but if ever you're in my arms again

-  Phil, not now. - Yes, now.

- I don't want to look at this picture...

- when I'm 80 years old and you're long dead...

- and know that you were angry at me when we took it.

- Phil, we'll talk about what you did later.

- Okay, everybody. Eyes over here.

- I didn't do anything. She kissed me.

- What?

-  Who kissed you? - Gloria.

-  What? - It was the kiss cam.

- Why did you kiss Cam?

- No, I kissed Phil. He told me I had to.

-  No, no. - Okay, hang on a second.

- Was this before or after

- you ignored the phone call from your wife?

- You saw that too?

- Could we please just take the damn picture?

- Okay. Everybody, one more time.

-  Just so you know, I am angry with you. - I knew it!

-  Oh, damn it! - It was a big day for me,

- and he didn't want to go because he doesn't like small talk.

- Would it be terribly inconvenient...

- to just postpone this hissy fit for a few minutes?

- Ok, you know what? Maybe some of us don't

-  want to take a picture today. - Thank you.

- And please, Claire,

- don't try to make Mitchell do something he doesn't wanna do.

- Oh, shut up, Cam.

- Okay, stop it! Stop it!

- Everyone, listen. This took me forever to put together,

- so I don't really care

- who kissed who and who's got a pimple on her head...

- and who is wearing an outrageously inappropriate dress.

- We are gonna get together and act like a normal family...

- for one-tenth of a freaking second,

- and we're gonna do it right now.

-  Come on, let's go. - Get your hands off of me.

- No. No. Make me. Make me.

- Ah, this is ridiculous. You're both uptight about everything.

- You didn't want to go to a wedding with him

- because you didn't want to make small talk?

- That's how I met Gloria.

- Do you remember the first thing I said to you?

- Yes. "I like chocolate,

- I like fruit, but not together."

- You couldn't come up with that, lvy League? And you.

- You would be a lot happier if you weren't

- so obsessed with everything being perfect.

- Look at us here all in white. What are we, a cricket team?

- News flash. Life is not perfect, Claire.

- Now calm the hell down.

- Okay, Dad, that's great, and that's really easy for you to say.

- But do you think I like being like this?

- No, I don't.

- So if you have some quick-and-easy fix,

- why don't you just give it to me right now?

-  Jay! - Oh, my God.

- I- I got this, baby.

- No. What did- What did you do?

- Now two people are dirty.

- Well, three.

- Okay, you know what?

- That's for "Kitschy."

- Mud fight!

- No. Don't do that. No, no, no! Stop it!

- Everybody get back in line. Come on, guys, stop.

- Damn it. Damn it! Guys!

- Excuse me.

- Are we still doing this?

- No. No, we're not.

-  Now we are. - We're ready!

-  Say "cheese." - Say "cheese"!

- Back in '68, when I was sweeping up hair in that barbershop,

- I had this mental picture of the family that,

- if I was lucky enough,

- one day I would end up with- perfect wife, perfect kids.

- Guess what. I didn't get any of that.

- Wound up with this sorry bunch.

- And I'm thankful for that every day.

- Well, most days.

- I think I'm just gonna go with the Elvis stuff.

- Yeah. I would.

- Uh, to the right. To the right.

- A skosh to the left.

- There we go.

- Whatever. I'm gonna have to take the picture down

- when I repaint the wall anyhow.

-  Kill me now. - What?

- Don't know how I got so lucky.

- I love you.

-  I love that picture. - Yeah.

-  Is that a chip on the frame right there? - No. No.

-  I can see it. - Honey.
